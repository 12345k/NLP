      "SoftBank's $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar:In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources,cloutand name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, Indias largestdigital-paymentsstartup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish givenPaytm'sdominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo,Alibabaand Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted.\n",
      "Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking CatEven by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. Its hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million.Jinkewont say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. Theres been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor.According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isnt stopping to ask questions. A vegan, hes using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation. Its not easy, he says, to find buyers for a $1 billion company. The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations theyd never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earningsmore than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once its part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world.\n",

      "As self-driving cars hit the road, real estate development may takenewdirection:The much-hyped transition to autonomous cars, while still years, or even decades, away, according to experts, is an opportunity and challenge that haswidepotential to reshape our transportation systems.But many believe that as city planners, transportation officials, and, eventually, developers start grappling with the changes to come, autonomous vehicles potential to reshape real estate, development, and city planning will rival that of the introduction of the automobile. At the American Planning Associations annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldnt reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.\n",
      "Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says:Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Ubers development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber andWaymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Googles parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,automakersand start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, WaymoL.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files fromWaymoimmediately before leaving his employment there.He added, Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession ofWaymosconfidential files.Judge Alsup also ruled thatWaymosignificantly overreached when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not secret, since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees, Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowskis hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files toWaymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowskis employment at Uber.Despite the judges ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.\n",
      "Extortionists Mount Global Hacking Attack Seeking Ransom:Extortionist hackers who may be using leaked computer exploits from the U.S. National Security Agency infiltrated computers in dozens of countries in a fast-spreading attack that forced British hospitals to turn away patients and breached systems at Spains Telefonica SA and organizations from Russia to Taiwan.The ransomware used in Fridays cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia,Ukraineand Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that havent applied Microsofts two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that dont routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.\n"

He hada Ouijaboard in his lap and waslivestreamingthe experience to a group of fans on YouTube. Youre not ever supposed to do Ouija alone, let alone in a place that had an exorcism done in it, he said to the empty room. As he filmed last month, the comments rolled in, some admiring (You are one brave ghost hunter), others fearing for his safety (Tim, dont summon what u cant banish). Mr. Wood, 39, has amassed a small but loyal following by making online videos of ghost hunts and paranormal activity, using YouTube to broadcast his work since about 2013. Automatically placed advertisements on his channel, LiveScifi, which has about 470,000 subscribers, have allowed him to turn the videos into a full-time job.But in the wake of a recent advertiser exodus from YouTube, prompted by major brands discovering they were showing up on videos promoting hate speech and terrorism, his earnings have plunged. Mr. Wood, who lives in San Francisco with his fiance and their infant, said his channel had brought in at least $6,000 a month in revenue last year  which helped pay for travel to site locations, the production of his videos and his other day-to-day bills. In January, his estimated revenue was about $3,900. In February and March, he was alarmed to see that drop below $3,000. Last month, he saw around $1,600 and has been using crowdfunding to cover his shooting costs.In February and March, a slew of advertisers yanked their money from the platform, prompting YouTube to tighten its default settings for where ads appear and to offer new ways for brands to manually and automatically avoid material that violates its guidelines.

His firm recently conducted a survey of 100 YouTube creators and said that channels focused on comedy and gaming experienced the sharpest drops in revenue last month compared with February. At the same time, creators in food,beautyand fashion, and family and parenting hadincreases.

He said the company is valued at more than $2 billion.Ofos ubiquitous canary-yellow bikes are among more than 25 services now crowding Chinas sidewalks.

      "Virtual Reality Companies Navigate The Trough of Disillusionment:Twelve months ago the Virtual Reality World Congress in Bristol, England, was a sell-out show, with over 750 attendees gawping over the latest VR hardware and production techniques. This year's event, which took place last week,attracted even moreparticipants -- more than 1,200 over three days -- but the mood felt decidedly less upbeat. Virtual reality, it seems, has been mugged by reality. Sales of VR hardware have fallen 40 percent behind forecasts, CCS Insight, a technology research group, said in a February report. And the VR hardware that is selling has mostly been relatively inexpensive goggles that allow people to experience VR through their smartphones, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Google's Daydream, not higher-end, dedicated headsets such as those made by Sony Corp, Facebook Inc.'s Oculus and HTC Corp. Many working in VR have run up against the hard economic reality of trying to produce content for a technology that remains, at least for the moment, fairly niche. As disappointment is setting in for virtual reality, expectations are building around its less glamorous cousin, augmented reality, which is also sometimes called mixed reality because it places digitally-rendered elements in the real observed environment. In 2016, Pokemon Go, which is an augmented reality game played on smartphones, became a worldwide phenomenon. Microsoft launched its high-end AR headset, HoloLens, which has found customers mostly among industrial and business users -- such as aeronautical engineers and architects. Snap Inc.'s AR photo filters are one of the most popular features of its messaging service and Facebook has announced a big push into the field with its own AR camera filters. Many now expect Apple Inc. to introduce an augmented reality product in the next year, which might help AR to leapfrog VR to achieve mass adoption. Technology company ABI Research says that virtual reality currently generates about 50 percent more revenue than augmented reality but that it relies heavily on hardware sales. Augmented reality, by contrast, relies more on software and in many cases can be experienced by users with their existing smartphones. ABI forecasts that AR revenues will surpass VR sales by 2019. Virtual reality true believers, like Taylor, are dismissive of the idea that AR might outrun VR as a blockbuster consumer technology. Augmented reality requires too much training for the average consumer to learn how to integrate the digital images into the real world, Taylor said. \"Mixing the virtual world and the real world is less natural,\" he said. Simply popping on a headset and diving into a completely virtual environment is, somewhat counter-intuitively, easier, he said. ABI Research still forecasts that virtual reality device shipments will reach 110 million units by 2021 -- huge growth considering only about 6.3 million such devices were shipped last year, according to tech research company Super Data.\n",

Zak's lawsuit was the latest to accuse companies of trying to boost profit by quietly amassing customer information, and then selling it or using it to solicit more business.After paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose's suggestion to \"get the most out of your headphones\" by downloading itsapp,and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process.But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent \"all available media information\" from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and \"send it anywhere.\"Audio choices offer \"an incredible amount of insight\" into customers' personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might \"very likely\" be a Muslim, the complaint said.Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app's user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection.

Snaps new technology, a 3-D lens, can also change and shift in response to physical objects.Snap said in a blog post that it launched lenses  which are images that people can superimpose on their selfies  a year and a half ago to give users more ways to express themselves. These features added whimsy and color to Snapchats messaging service, which has drawn an avid base of users and has helped propel new forms of digital advertising. Partly powered by Snapchats fan base and advertising business, Snap went public last month. But the companys stock has fallen as Facebook and its many brands have copied the features that once made Snapchat unique. Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook all now have a feature that mimics Snapchat Stories, which lets people string together their images in an ongoing story that disappears after 24 hours.Facebook recently introduced a user interface for its app that also resembles the camera-first interface pioneered by Snapchat. It also lets people send messages that disappear, another innovation popularized by Snapchat.

Snap reported an average of 158 million active daily users at the end of 2016.Snaps share price has dropped from a high of $27 to a low of about $19, and the Facebook clones are very likely to be a concern for shareholders when Snap reports its first earnings as a public company next month.\n",

      "China Tech Investment Flying Under the Radar, Pentagon Warns:China is investing in Silicon Valley start-ups with military applications at such a rapid rate that the United States government needs tougher controls to stem the transfer of some of Americas most promising technologies, a Pentagon report says.There are few restrictions on investing in American start-ups that focus on artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robotics, the report contends, and China has taken advantage. Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States.In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius. If we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating Chinas technological superiority, the report says.\n",

Tesla, the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge.On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit.While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth.Investors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story, said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. Nobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that.At the end of Mondays trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Fords $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion.Teslas market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its first-quarter sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago.

      "Dyson Is the Apple of Appliances (and Just as Secretive):When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner.But Mr. Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks.Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001, was too clunky for James Dyson, the companys founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect.As smartphones became everyday tools, Dysons robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications  with a heat map of where it had cleaned  to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year.At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for, Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dysons rural headquarters near the border with Wales. But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow. Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades  and tens of millions of dollars  building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop.But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the nonglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers  and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware.Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, the smartwatch maker Fitbit and the camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson inrarefiedcompany alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets.\n",

      "Uber president Jeff Jonesquits,deepening turmoil:Ride services company Uber Technologies has been thrust deeper into turmoil with the departure of company president Jeff Jones, a marketing expert hired to help soften its often abrasive image.Jones quit less than seven months after joining the San Francisco company, an Uber spokesman said on Sunday.The reason for his departure was not immediately clear, but Jones' role was put into question after Uber earlier this month launched a search for a chief operating officer to help run the company alongside Chief Executive Travis Kalanick. Jones is the latest in a string of high-level executives to leave the company. Last month, engineering executive Amit Singhal was asked to resign due to a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his previous job at Alphabet Inc's Google. Earlier this month, Ed Baker, Uber's vice president of product and growth, and Charlie Miller, Uber's famed security researcher, departed.Uber, while it has long had a reputation as an aggressive and unapologetic startup, has been battered with multiple controversies over the last several weeks that have put Kalanick's leadership capabilities and the company's future into question.A former Uber employee last month published a blog post describing a workplace where sexual harassment was common and went unpunished. The blog post prompted an internal investigation that is being led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.Then, Bloomberg released a video that showed Kalanick berating an Uber driver who had complained about cuts to rates paid to drivers, resulting in Kalanick making a public apology. And earlier this month Uber confirmed it had used a secret technology program dubbed \"Greyball,\" which effectively changes the app view for specific riders, to evade authorities in cities where the service has been banned. Uber has since prohibited the use ofGreyballto target local regulators.\n",

Avast, which counts more than 400 million users of its anti-virus software worldwide, was named in the WikiLeaks documents as one of the security vendors targeted by the CIA in a leaked page labeled \"secret\" but lacking further details.The leaks - which WikiLeaks described as the biggest in the Central Intelligence Agency's history - had enough technical details for security experts and product vendors to recognize that widespread compromises exist.

      "Google may have missed a big chance to become a major smartphone maker:Since its October launch, Google's Pixel phone has received rave reviews, and Google recently confirmed to the Android-focused publication Android Pit that it will release a new Pixel this year. Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front and may have missed an opportunity to capitalize on competitors' missteps.While Google doesn't break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation.To put that in perspective, Google's market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one percent worldwide  as compared to Samsung's 18 percent and Apple's 18.2 percent  said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation.On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel's Google branding, Samsung's Note 7 problems, and criticism of Apple's latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is a solid phone thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant.The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google forfullprice of $649  and take it to another carrier if they want  that's not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about.Compounding the availability issue, Moore said, is that stores are having trouble keeping the phones in stock. That's a good sign for Google in terms of demand, but also a bad sign for the company in terms of being able to capitalize on that demand, he said.\n",
      "How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide:Uber has for years engaged in a worldwide program to deceive the authorities in markets where its low-cost ride-hailing service was resisted by law enforcement or, in some instances, had been banned.The program, involving a tool calledGreyball, uses data collected from the Uber app and other techniques to identify and circumvent officials who were trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service. Uber used these methods to evade the authorities in cities like Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, and in countries like Australia,Chinaand South Korea.Greyballwas part of a program called VTOS, short for violation of terms of service, which Uber created to root out people it thought were using or targeting its service improperly. The program, includingGreyball, began as early as 2014 and remains in use, predominantly outside the United States.Greyballwas approved by Ubers legal team.Greyballand the VTOS program were described to The New York Times by four current and former Uber employees, who also provided documents. The four spoke on the condition of anonymity because the tools and their use are confidential and because of fear of retaliation by Uber. One technique involved drawing a digital perimeter, or geofence, around the government offices on a digital map of a city that Uber was monitoring. The company watched which people were frequently opening and closing the app  a process known internally as eyeballing  near such locations as evidence that the users might be associated with city agencies.Other techniques included looking at a users credit card information and determining whether the card was tied directly to an institution like a police credit union.Enforcement officials involved in large-scale sting operations meant to catch Uber drivers would sometimes buy dozens ofcellphonesto create different accounts. To circumvent that tactic, Uber employees would go to local electronics stores to look up device numbers of the cheapest mobile phones for sale, which were often the ones bought by city officials working with budgets that were not large.In all, there were at least a dozen or so signifiers in the VTOS program that Uber employees could use to assess whether users were regular new riders or probably city officials.If such clues did not confirm a users identity, Uber employees would search social media profiles and other information available online. If users were identified as being linked to law enforcement, Uber Greyballed them by tagging them with a small piece of code that read Greyball followed by a string of numbers.When someone tagged this way called a car, Uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see, or show that no cars were available. Occasionally, if a driver accidentally picked up someone tagged as an officer, Uber called the driver with instructions to end the ride.\n",

And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns  technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors  that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years. Snaps offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share  a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose.Those buying into Snaps offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the companys founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap.Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year. With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error.\n",

      "Ubers SVP of engineering is out after he did not disclose he left Google in a dispute over a sexual harassment allegation:Amit Singhal has left his job at Uber as its SVP of engineering because he did not disclose to the car-hailing company that he left Google a year earlier after top executives there informed him of an allegation of sexual harassment from an employee that an internal investigation had found credible.Singhal was asked to resign by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick this morning.Uber execs found out about the situation after Recode informed them of the chain of events between Singhal and the search giant this week. Indeed. According to multiple sources and internal notes read to me, after discussing the claims of an alleged encounter between Singhal and a female employee first with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015, he denied those claims at the time. He also apparently stated a number of times that there were two sides to every story.But, after the Christmas holidays, he then decided to resign himself after a 15-year career there.Sources said that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned.\n",

      "AlphabetsWaymois suing Otto and Uber for allegedly stealing the design of a key self-driving system:Waymo, formerly Googles self-driving car unit, is suing Otto  the self-driving trucking company co-founded by formerWaymoemployee Anthony Levandowski and quickly acquired by Uber  for allegedly stealing the companys proprietary design for its laser-based radar system.According toWaymo, before Levandowski left what was then a part of Googles moonshot labs, he downloaded 14,000 highly confidential files to an external hard drive, including the design for the companys lidar circuit board.The company decided to perform a forensic investigation of Levandowskis former company computer after aWaymoemployee was inadvertently copied on an email from a lidar supplier with the subject line Otto Files. The email was being sent to a list of people thatWaymobelieves were Uber employees. Attached to the email were drawings of Ottos lidar circuit board.It looked just likeWaymosdesign, the company alleged in the suit filed today, the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.The Replicated Board reflectsWaymoshighly confidential proprietary LiDAR technology andWaymotrade secrets, the complaint reads. Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many otherWaymotrade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered byWaymopatents.To then verify its suspicions,Waymofileda public recordsrequest to the Nevada Governors Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles in February for Ottos communications with the departments.In that correspondence, Otto indicated that the company was using custom lidar that it built in-house.Waymocites this as evidence that Uber and Otto are using a circuit board that bears a striking resemblance toWaymos. Lidars are seen by most as a crucial piece of self-driving technology. The radar shoots lasers at objects in order to detect them and works closely with the cameras and normal radars to create a thorough image of the cars surroundings.\n",
      "Snapdeal orders masslay-off:Once a success story of the burgeoning start-up ecosystem, Gurgaon-based online marketplace Snapdeal on Wednesday said it would cut more jobs, stop paying its founders and sell its digital wallet FreeCharge.

It has also put on sale FreeCharge and is in talks with Naspers, the South Africa-based internet group, to sell it for $300 million. Though the company refused to divulge the exact number of people to be sacked, sources close to the development said 800 employees would be laid off over the next few days. Sources confirmed 100 were asked to go on the day itself, within a few minutes of Bahls email.By the time we finished reading the mail, HR (human resource) called us to their office. They said we would get three months of severance pay. We said yes, as that was the only option on the table, said an employee who was sacked on Wednesday.According to sources, employees from marketing, ad-tech, category, digital marketing, engineering team,catalogues, have all been asked to leave.

She gave her account in a lengthy post on her personal blog on Sunday.It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR, Ms. Fowler wrote. Upper management told me that he was a high performer (i.e. had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldnt feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part.Ms. Fowler left Uber in December and this year joined Stripe, a payments processing start-up. Ms. Fowlers story is particularly resonant because of Ubers reputation for having an intense workplace culture with high turnover.Hours after Ms. Fowlers post, Travis Kalanick, Ubers chief executive, said it was the first time the issue had come to his attention. He said he had instructed Liane Hornsey, the companys recently hired chief of human resources, to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.\n",
      "People love GIFs  but turning GIFs into ad dollars is taking some time:About 15 months ago, Tenor was trying to get its GIF search engine onto as many phones as possible. So it did the logical thing  it partnered with businesses that were already on a lot of phones.The startup, which offers a universal GIF keyboard that you can download to your phone, also signed deals with Messenger, iMessage and Kik to put its technologyinsidetheir messaging apps so users could easily search through Tenors library of GIFs (which are short looping video clips), and send them off to friends inside of private conversations.The deals appear to have worked: Tenor, which rebranded in October from Riffsy, says people are using its GIF search engine 200 million times per day, up from 50 million daily searches 15 months ago. It has 200 million monthly active users, a number that has also quadrupled in the same amount of time.As people are sending more and more messages, theyre sending more and more GIFs.But despite user growth, Tenor is still dealing with the same question Recode was asking 15 months ago: Are GIFs a real business Tenor CEO David McIntosh remains adamant that they are, though his company still isnt making any revenue despite all the messaging deals. As of October, Giphy, a competitor recently valued at $600 million, wasnt bringing in any revenue, either. Turning those views into dollars may still be a ways off. McIntosh says that Tenor has just 22 employees, and needs to build out a sales organization. It also needs to create interest in what McIntosh believes is a new kind of targeting.The challenge is that this is a brand-new format that has to be invented, he said. Theres no ad inventory today around marketers that want to purchase against emotion, and have assets that they want to buy against.\n",

      "UberGives Restless Employees a Way to Cash Out:Many longtime employees of Uber Technologies Inc. are multi-millionaires, at least on paper. But with no initial public offeringin sightand a strict policy blocking most private share sales, theyre stuck in limbo.However, theres a little-known option available to Uber loyalists looking to cash out. Those who work at the San Francisco company for at least four years can sell as much as 10 percent of their shares, people familiar with the matter said. The program has a built-in incentive to entice staff to stick around. The seller gets paid out over many months and must remain at Uber during that time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they werent authorized to discuss the program publicly.The formal plan, which has been in effect for a couple years but was previously unreported, caps buybacks at well below $10 million per employee, one of the people said. Fewer than 200 ofthe some10,000 people employed by Uber currently qualify for the program, the person said.Although well-compensated by any rational standard, startup employees often take pay cuts compared with what they could receive at Facebook Inc. or Google. They join knowing a chunk of their pay is tied to the fortunes of their employer and could become worthless. What many workers hadnt bargained for was how long theyd have to wait to find out what would happen. Airbnb Inc. and Pinterest Inc. were founded around the same time as Uber, achieved valuations in excess of $10 billion and yet remain private. But the two companies have at times allowed their employees to sell shares to interested buyers and even facilitated some of those transactions.

And he has built an interesting,rather uniquebusiness, self-publishing his Stratechery blog and subscription-based email newsletter from Taiwan, where he lives. I felt I hadinsightto offer that people would find valuable, Thompson told Recode Senior Editor Peter Kafka, by focusing on writing about technology and business strategy and not just products. Thompson was working at Microsoft when he started the publication in2013,and launched his subscription business  currently $10 per month, or $100 per year  in 2014.The internet enables niche in a massively powerful way, where you can focus and be really good at one thing, Thompson said. And because youre not constrained to a geographic area, you can reach the entire world. I have subscribers in 30 countries.How many subscribersA lot. Kafka asked: What about joining up with a venture capital firm and collecting a big paycheck as a public intellectual as others have done  a group that includes famous dot-com-era analyst Mary Meeker, whos now at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Benedict Evans, who built a following on Twitter and now works at Andreessen Horowitz. That seems like a better life than having to schlep $10 subscriptions.People underestimate the scale of the internet, Thompson said. Certainly I work hard, but the amount of work Im doing today is the exact same amount of work I was doing three years ago. The only difference is my income is 100 times higher.

      "Twitter advertising revenue falls, shares drop more than 10 percent:Twitter Inc posted the slowest revenue growth since it went public four years ago, sending shares down more than 10 percent on Thursday on fears that rivals Snapchat and Facebook Inc(FB.O) were winning the war for advertising. Revenue from advertising fell from a year ago and a 4.0 percent year-on-year rise in users to 319 million fell short of Wall Street forecasts as well. Total revenue grew 1.0 percent to $717.2 million. The election of prolific tweeter Donald Trump as U.S. president failed to produce a \"Trump Bump\" in Twitter's results, and Twitter declined to give guidance on future revenue with Chief Executive Jack Dorsey asking for patience. The microblogging service has struggled to find a formula that will attract a new crop of users or advertisers even as rivals have ridden a wave of rising investment in internet advertising. The lack of revenue growth has raised questions about Dorsey's leadership and whether the company would be bought by a bigger media firm. Financial markets speculated about a sale of Twitter last year, but no concrete bids were forthcoming. Dorsey also faced concerns about his dual role as the chief executive of both Twitter and Square Inc. \"Running two companies is not the best idea,\" Steve Ballmer, a Twitter investor and a former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) chief executive, told CNBC. Twitter was also hit by a string of executive departures in 2016, including in its products team, which had three heads in less than a year. In October, the company said it would cut 9.0 percent of its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring. Twitter's net loss widened to $167.1 million, or 23 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $90.24 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier.\n",
      "Pinterest users can now jump to other products within an image:The company today said its launching a new feature that allows users to find and jump to additional products within a photo theyre currently viewing. So, for example, if a search for a jacket brings up an image of someone wearing that jacket, Pinterest will also identify other products like the jeans and shoes theyre wearing. That means that if a business is trying to show off their products, users will have yet another way to jump to similar products theyre showing on Pinterest. All this is a result of the companys major investments in image search. Pinterest has largely built a name for itself because of its strong image search capabilities, and that thus far has been its selling point for advertisers. While companies like Google can capture the intent of a user directly searching for a product, Pinterest also taps into moments where potential customers are just meandering around and might stumble onto a product they may later buy. The act of saving that can also signal an intent to advertisers for a purchase, which is yet another touchpoint for those marketers to convert them into a sale.\n",
      "Snap has financially handcuffed itself to Google Cloud:The S-1 Registration Statement just issued by Snap is (as these documents usually are) highly illuminating into the inner workings of this business. While the company has managed to grab a massive user base, there are a number of red flags in the business that are sure to give potential investors pause, not the least of which is the current annual loss of more than $500 million. However, theres something even more remarkable hidden in that financial loss that would make me think twice about investing in this software business: The fact that Snap has handcuffed itself to Google Cloud and (in doing so) is not in control over some key parts of their business and costs for the foreseeable future.In its disclosure, Snap has said that it is contractually obligated to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and have built our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google. Of the current losses at Snap, more than 80 percent of those funds go straight into Googles pockets. Snap is often compared to Facebook and Twitter, and it is certainly hoping for an IPO that rivals Facebooks extraordinary valuation. So, how have these companies handled infrastructureFamously, both social networks have built out their own cloud infrastructure. Facebook has a number of data centers which operate as a single cloud, all running a host of open source tools (in contrast to the proprietary on-demand services of public cloud providers), and it has even open sourced its hardware designs. Twitter famously solved their early Fail Whale issues with scale by shifting their entire platform to Apache Mesos, and now has one of the most resilient and cost effective cloud infrastructures in the business.\n",
      "Siemens completes key test of 3D-printed gas-turbine blades:German engineering group Siemens has run a successful test of power generation gas turbine blades produced wholly by metal-based 3D printing by UK-based Materials Solutions, which it bought last year.Siemens said on Monday it was the first to test such blades under full-load engine conditions at 13,000 revolutions per minutes and temperatures above 1,250 Celsius (2,282 Fahrenheit). It called the test a \"breakthrough\".3D printing, also called additive manufacturing, involves making a three-dimensional object by adding ultra-thin layers of material one by one, following a digital design, in contrast to conventional manufacturing, where excess material is cut away.Siemens' U.S. rival General Electric bought two 3D printing firms last year for over $1 billion and introduced its first 3D-printed aircraft engine component into service last July.

      "Snap's IPO to Be Haunted by Twitter and GoPro:Snap has gone to great lengths to distance itself from comparisons to Twitter Inc., the last big social media public offering. In its filing for an initial share sale, the maker of the Snapchat mobile app emphasized that it measures itself by daily active users -- a metric that Twitter doesn't disclose. Snap explained that its users tell stories chronologically, unlike the Twitter timeline, which displays most recent posts first. The younger company also said it plans to focus on developed markets, instead of racing to find users all over the world. Snap calls itself a \"camera company,\" rather than focusing on its messaging app or media content.No matter the positioning, Snap's numbers raise the same questions Twitter's did. User growth is slowing and losses are mounting, but revenue gains are a bright spot. That's how Twitter's financial details looked when it filed to go public in 2013, and the investor concern has never subsided, even after a spate of executive departures made way for new management and initiatives to jump-start user growth. Twitter's revenue started to slow when advertisers realized that with stagnant user growth, there wasn't a reason to spend more. Snap is also trying to avoid one of Twitter's IPO mistakes. Twitter compared itself in strategy to social media giant Facebook, but ultimately it paled in contrast to its rapidly growingrival,and has gotten punished by investors since then. Instead, Snap frames itself as a portfolio company, the owner of the Snapchat app, the Spectacles wearable video camera, andmanymore things to come. At the heart ofitall is the idea of the camera -- because ``the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones.'' The word \"camera\" is mentioned 79 times in the IPO filing.That approach may bring another uncomfortable parallel. GoPro Inc., which makes small wearableaction-videocameras beloved by extreme sports aficionados and outdoor enthusiasts, had its own highly anticipated public offering in 2014. It had a premise similar to Snap: capturing memories in the moment they happen, with the raw perspective of the user. As demand for its devices subsided, GoPro aimed instead to be a media company, seeking to generate more revenue from content that users created and selling advertising. That hasn't worked out as planned. GoPro recently cut 200 jobs and its entire entertainment unit, and its shares now trade for less than half their IPO price. Other makers of wearable devices, including Fitbit,Jawboneand Pebble, haven't fared much better.\n",
      "Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 billion IPO pitch:Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits.Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users.The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before.While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product.\"What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost.Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015.Snap's biggest losses stem from \"hosting fees\" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services.Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost ofthese serviceis high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage.\"They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,\" said SharesPost's Kulkarni.\n",
      "Facebook eases past Wall Street estimates, sees spending up in 2017:Facebook Inc (FB.O) cruised past Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations on Wednesday with strong growth in its mobile ad business, demonstrating that controversy over so-called \"fake news\" and inaccurate advertising measurements had little impact on its financial performance.Withquarterlyprofit of $3.57 billion, more than double the $1.56 billion it reported a year ago, the company showed no signs ofslowdownin growth. The results handily beat analysts' expectations, and shares ticked up about 0.2 percent in after-hours trading.The company had warned in November that ad growth would likely slow \"meaningfully\" due to limits on ad load - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user.

      "Lyft rides a wave of anger to the top of the App Store:This weekend, Uber and Lyft  in their reactions to the Trump administrations immigration order  illustrated how important companies' political views have become to consumers. Lyft took a public stand against the order and, on Sunday, saw more downloads than Uber for the first time ever, according to analysis firm App Annie. Lyft's Sunday downloads also more than doubled its daily average over the previous two weeks.Uber, on the other hand, had a bad weekend. Hundreds of people called for ride-sharers to ditch the company through the hashtag #deleteUber after it announced that it would drop surge pricing for John F. Kennedy Airport trips. Many saw Ubers move as an attempt to undermine the strike that New York City cabdrivers organized to protest the immigration order and capitalize off the controversy  something Uber was quick to deny. It also didn't help Uber's standing among President Trump's critics that its chief executive is on the administration's business advisory committee. The social reaction to the Uber-Lyft divide was immediate. App Annie confirmed that Lyft climbed the app charts on both Apple and Android phones this weekend. It overtook Uber to reach No. 1 on the Apple App Store.That bump came despite the fact that Lyft didnt suspend its service during the strike either and despite Lyft's ties to another close Trump ally, investor Peter Thiel. Its pledge over the weekend, however, seemed to speak louder than those facts  and louder than a later Uber vow to devote $3 million to help its drivers with immigration legal costs.\n",
      "Silicon Valleys Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger:Mr. Trumps executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran,Iraqand five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valleys cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its embrace-the-world approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration.In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades.Netflixs chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trumps actions are so un-American it pains us all and that it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. We must stand with those who are affected, he wrote on Twitter.Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.\n",
      "Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings:Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, appsalesand the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion.The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability.

      "Cisco snaps up AppDynamics for $3.7B right before its IPO:Cisco said today that it would acquire AppDynamics, which helps companies monitor application performance, for a whopping $3.7 billion.And now, it would seem that AppDynamics long-awaited IPO (this week!) has been called off in favor of a giant acquisition. It isnt Ciscos first major acquisition in recent memory  in fact, the company has been quite active  with the company paying $1.4 billion for Jasper Technologies. All these seem to be moving Cisco from its era of its core hardware networking business. The idea ofnetworking in generalhas evolved over time as new kinds of devices find their way onto the Internet, and now it would seem Cisco is continuing that move beyond its usual competency.AppDynamics may have even been testing the waters of the IPO market to set a value for itself for negotiations with larger companies for a potential acquisition. Its not entirely uncommon that companies are working to not only drop a filing and intent to go public while having acquisition talks behind the scenes. AppDynamics previously raised $314.5million,and was most recently valued at $1.9 billion. So the exit looks like its about a 2x jump from its previous valuation  which is not all that bad of an outcome in the scope of larger enterprise deals. The deal will be in cash and assumed equity awards, Cisco said in a statement.\n",
      "Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Signals Problems at Korea Inc.With the Note 7, Samsung pushed its business model, as well as its technology, to the limit, according to Samsung officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the Note 7 investigation was being completed. Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apples iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security.But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws.UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred.Samsungs insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say. In place of big new ideas, Samsung focused on maxing out the capability of components like the battery. That philosophy, which worked to keep Samsung on the heels of the likes of Apple, simply is not as effective as Samsung tries to push ahead, they argue. But for many of the companys critics, the most interesting part of the presentation was what Samsung did not say: How could such a technologically advanced titan  a symbol of South Koreas considerable industrial might  allow the problems tohappento begin with The answer to that questiongets todeep shortfalls that former employees, suppliers and others who watch the company say may have contributed to the incident. Samsung, like South Korea as a whole, fosters a top-down, hidebound culture that stifles innovation and buries festering problems, they say. For those critics, these problems have come to light through another front: politics. Samsung has been caught up in a scandal surrounding the countrys president, which they say illustrates a hierarchical culture that tends to micromanage away creativity and insulate family-run business empires from accountability and competition.\n",

      "Snapchat embraces offline purchase ad targeting:Snap will now allow advertisers to use Oracles Data Cloud (formerly Datalogix) third-party data about what users buy offline to target ads on Snapchat, according to The Wall Street Journal. Snap tells TechCrunch that this rolled out over the last few weeks, and will allow targeting to 100 different customer demographics like cosmetics shopper or consumer tech shopper.Yet the ad targeting based on what people buy at the grocery store that Snapchat is now offering fits that bill. Spiegel was talking about retargeted ads for specific products you looked at online. But offline purchase targeting will also produce ads that have users wondering, How did they know I buy that How Snaps new ad targeting works - First, Oracle Data Cloud collects data from retail stores about what you buy. Normally the company offers thousands of different demographic profiles and even specific brand buyers that businesses can target, but Snapchat has whittled that down to 100. These include mens clothing buyer or car shopper. All uploaded user IDs and email addresses are hashed for privacy, encrypted and anonymized, and Snap matches them to its users.Snapchat advertisers can then ask to target one of these segments of users and measure their impact on offline purchases, and they buy the ads through an auction or directly from Snap. Its currently testing the targeting system with brands like Honda,Kiaand The Honest Company.\n",

      "Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial:Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has said virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology. While virtual reality hasnt quite reached the mainstream, it has succeeded in landing Mr. Zuckerberg in the middle of a courtroom fight over who owns a crucial piece of the technology.The dispute started two and a half years ago when a videogame publisher, ZeniMax Media, sued Oculus VR, a start-up behind a virtual reality headset, only months after Facebook announced that it would acquire Oculus for $2 billion. ZeniMax accused Oculus of stealing important elements of the technology that went into the creation of the headset, eventually including Facebook among the parties it was suing.While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by making it to a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg made a rare appearance in court and was questioned about the Oculus deal. While pushing back on accusations that Oculus took technology that it didnt own, Mr. Zuckerberg said it was his first time testifying in a courtroom.We are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology, said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit while testifying, instead of his regular uniform of a hoodie and jeans. The idea that Oculus products are based on someone elses technology is just wrong. Facebook could face hefty damages if it loses the suit, which could make its payoff from virtual reality recede further into the future. While virtual reality has excited people in the technology industry, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them.The core of ZeniMaxs case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the early days of Oculus, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.\n",

What's left of the embattled technology company would essentially be its ownership in the very valuable Chinese Internet giant Alibaba.When the deal closes, the remaining part will change its name toAltaba, the company announced in security filings on Monday.

The idea behind the name is thatAltabasstock can now be tracked as an alternative to Alibaba because Yahoo owns a sizable chunk of the Chinese company.The name change reflects just how far Yahoo has fallen. The company that was once an Internet giant and is still the third most visited Web property in the United States is now essentially a vehicle for holding Alibaba's stock.The new company, which will be publicly traded and until now has been referred to as RemainCo in security filings, also owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, the companys Japanese affiliate, and Yahoos cash, as well as a patent portfolio that is being sold off in a separate auction.\n",

      "Two reasons the red Solo Cup is a marvel of modern engineering:The red Solo Cup is an elegant piece of technology. It's easy to forget when you find them strewn across the room, half-filled with leftover beer or crushed underfoot from parties the night before. But what many take for granted as simply a cheap, disposable beverage holder is the result of careful, beautiful engineering by people such as Robert Hulseman. While regular users may admire the Solo Cup's lightness and balance, particularly when filled to the brim with libation, some of the most underappreciated aspects of the cup can be traced to a simple design aimed at solving a rather sticky problem. Before the invention of the SoloCupas we know it, it was often difficult to remove one disposable cup from a whole stack because of the way they sometimes clung together, and designs aimed at eliminating the issue resulted in production irregularities that drove up costs and increased the likelihood of cup breakage. For a thing whose whole job is to hold other things, this outcome simply would not do. Enter the plastic Solo Cup, which won a patent in 1976. Described as \"an expendable thin walled cup for liquids and the like,\" the Solo Cup offered two key innovations that, according to the company, helped solve the sticking associated with large stacks of cups as well as the hard problem of cleanly removing the plastic cups from the production molds.One of the Solo Cup's distinguishing features, according to the patent, was the curved lip of each cup (see 10a in Fig.3). When several cups were stacked together, the lips would \"engage\"  to use the company's language  and rest upon each other, keeping one cup from sinking too tightly into the next. But, Solo Cup Co. observed, this helped create another problem. When cups like these were subjected to crushing forces from various angles, the bottoms could warp in ways that actually made it harder to separate the cups. So the bottoms had to be reinforced (see Fig. 4, Fig. 6 and 26-28 in Fig. 3). This is how the plastic Solo Cup gained indentations or divots in the base that made the bottoms more rigid and allowed for more air flow between each stacked cup, which allegedly had the side benefit of helping the cups come apart.\n"

Alexa is always listening through a system of seven built-in microphones but waits for you to say the wake word to send it commands, like asking for the weather or which music to play, according to the company.

      "WTF is a liquidation preference Lets walk through the basics.Broadly, a liquidation preference determines who gets what when a company is liquidated. This can mean when a company is merged, when its sold, when theres a change of control of the company or when theres a wind-down.In all of these scenarios, a companys liquidator looks at the companys secured and unsecured loan agreements, along with who owns preferred versus common stock. (Preferred shares are what VCs typically buy to ensure that theyre repaid ahead of holders of common shares.) Everyone on the companys cap table is ranked after that, and the liquidator distributes the proceeds of a sale accordingly. Consider the wind-down scenario. Lets say a company raised both venture capital and venture debt  a loan. Say that as time went on, it began falling behind on its debt payments, and that its VCs decided it was a losing proposition to continue funding the company. If there was any capital remaining  say the company hadnt burned through every last bit of its funding, or say some money was made from a sell-off of its remaining assets, like its intellectual property  its investors would be paid before anyone at the company saw a nickel.When the outcome is much better, the same thing basically happens  though who gets how much and when grows more complicated with every new round of funding a company raises. The reason: When investors make a liquidation preference a condition for investing in a startup, they do it in order to claim their part of the profits first. But later-stage investors can demand liquidation preferences that ensure they get paid before earlier investors, too. Its kind of like a layer cake. They can also demand that they get paid back more than the standard of one times their money back.Why would startups agree to these seemingly onerous terms Well, sometimes, they dont have any choice. They take the terms, or they go out of business. Sometimes, startups wanting unicorn status will agree to the terms for a richer valuation, thinking it will attract press, customers and employees. Whether its worth the gamble takes time to play out. But certainly, things can get ugly when these same companies get sold rather than go public (a process that converts everyones shares to common shares). Its uglier still when they sell for less than expected, the investors take their cut, and theres little to nothing left for founders and employees.Not every deal involves liquidation preferences. You dont typically see them in early-stage deals. You dont seem them in deals where a company has been created by a founder whom VCs trip over themselves to fund.

      "Snapchat buying Israeli augmented reality start-up Cimagine:report: Messaging app Snapchat is buying Israeli augmented reality startup Cimagine Media for an estimated $30-$40 million, marking Snapchat's first acquisition in Israel, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Sunday.Cimagine developed True Marketless Augmented Reality  technology that allows users to virtually place furniture and appliances they wish to purchase in the space of their home, on their mobile devices, at the click of a button.Cimagine will become Snapchat's research and development center in Israel and is expected to rapidly expand its workforce from its current 20 employees, Calcalist said.The company's highly-skilled team is probably the main reason for the acquisition, rather than its technology, Calcalist said.The company was founded in 2012 and has raised a few million dollars.Venice, California-based Snapchat is expected to go public as early as March with a valuation of as much as $25 billion.\n",

Facebooks China charm offensive, which included Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin, has yielded little. Googles search business and Twitter remain blocked. LinkedIn and Microsoft censor  and still, neither is a major player in Chinas online space. Amazon.com is sputtering along against the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. After great initial success, Apple is being overtaken by local upstarts. For somehighflyingU.S. Internet businesses, the China dream is fading; for others, it looks radically different from what they had hoped. Californias Internet companies once dreamed of liberating China with technology, thinking that the system of censorship known as the Great Firewall would inevitably crumble like the Berlin Wall, paving the way for their advance in the worlds most populous nation. But President Xi Jinping has tightened, rather than loosened, control of the Internet and increased restrictions on foreign companies. Six years after Google retreated from Chinas search-engine business over censorship and hacking concerns, U.S. firms seem more willing than ever to play the Communist Partys game  they just cant win it. Even if they can gain a foothold, which is hard enough, there is practically no way they will be able to overtake the Chinese companies that have comfortably established themselves.\n"

      "Uber removes its self-driving cars from San Francisco roads: Uber has removed its self-driving cars from San Francisco streets after California regulators cracked down on the week-old program because the company had not obtained a permit to test the vehicles.The California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Wednesday it revoked the registration of 16 Uber self-driving cars after a battle with the ride-services company. The agency had demanded that Uber comply with regulations requiring a permit to test self-driving cars on public roads - just as 20 other auto and technology companies have done.Uber said it was not obligated to have a permit because its vehicles require monitoring by a person in the car.California defines autonomous vehicles as having the capability to drive \"without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\"Uber has argued that its cars are not able to drive without a person monitoring them - a driver and an engineer are in the front seats to take over frequently in situations such as a construction zone or pedestrian crossing - so the law does not apply. Uber's defiance was met with threats of legal action from the DMV and the state attorney general.The DMV told Uber it can continue its self-driving pilot if it obtains the permit. Agency director Jean Shiomoto said in a letter sent to Uber on Wednesday that she would \"personally help to ensure an expedited review and approval process,\" which she described as \"simple and straightforward.\"It is not yet clear whether Uber will apply for the permit or simply bring the self-driving cars to another state.\n",

Although the main targets were in the United States, news organizations in other countries were also affected.To carry out the operation:TheMethbotforgers first took numeric internet addresses they controlled and falsely registered them in the names of well-known internet service providers.The forgers then associated the addresses with 571,904 bots designed to mimic human web surfers.The perpetrators connected the bots to the automated advertising networks that sell unsold ad space for thousands of websites.A bot would pretend to visit a website like CNN.com, and the ad networks would conduct a microsecond bidding war against one another to show a brands video ad. But instead of going to the real CNN, the bots web browser would go to a fake site that nobody could see, and the ad would play there.Finally, the system would report fake data to the ad networks and advertisers to convince them that humans had watched the ad on the real content site. The thieves then collected payment for the ads.\n",
      "Uber's Loss Exceeds $800 Million in Third Quarter on $1.7 Billion in Net Revenue:Even as Uber Technologies Inc. exited China, the company's financial loss has remained eye-popping. In the first nine months of this year, the ride-hailing company lost significantly more than $2.2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the third quarter, Uber lost more than $800 million, not including its Chinese operation. Uber's loss in the first quarter of this year was about $580 million, according to the person. By the second quarter, the loss significantly exceeded $800 million, including China. At the same time, the company's revenue has continued to grow even after leaving the world's most populous country.

By day, he was a police officer in northern China with a wife and a knack for street chases. By night, he led a life as a gay man, furtively running a website for gay people across China at a time when many were viewed as criminals and deviants. For 16 years, Mr. Ma kept his secret, worried that coming out would mean expulsion from the police force and estrangement from his family. Then in 2012, his superiors at a police department in Qinhuangdao, a coastal city in Hebei Province, uncovered his website and he resigned. His job lost, his family struggling to accept his sexuality, Mr. Ma set out to turn his passion for connecting gay people into an empire. He created Blued, now Chinas most popular gay dating app with an estimated value of $600 million and more than three million active daily users, about as many as Grindr, a popular gay dating app in the United States. Mr. Ma said he was optimistic that long-entrenched stereotypes were fading in China and that within two decades, the country would embrace ideas like same-sex marriage. He quoted his idol, the Alibaba.com founder Jack Ma, in describing both the challenge of building a successful start-up in China and the struggles of the gay-rights movement.

The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions  steps that it declined to take in September. It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked.

      "Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business:Googles parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the nameWaymo. Alphabets decision to spin outWaymois a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization. Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers  all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry. Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning  the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time  mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years. The challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesnt have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares  at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesnt have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain. It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems  akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google. Google has struggled to find a way to come to market, said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. Weve come to the point where Google needs a return.\n"

Nothing happens  and thats a good thing. Mr. Zimmermans battery is a new spin on lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in products from smartphones to cars. Todays lithium-ion batteries, as anyone who has followed Samsungs recent problems with flammablesmartphonesmay know, can be ticking time bombs. The liquids in them can burst into flames if there is a short circuit of some sort. And driving a nail into one of them is definitely not recommended. With that in mind, Mr. Zimmermans demonstration commands attention. His Woburn, Mass., start-up, Ionic Materials, is at the cutting edge of an effort to design safer batteries. The company is working on solid lithium polymer batteries that greatly reduce their combustible nature.My dream is to create the holy grail of solid batteries, Mr. Zimmerman said. After four years of development, he believes he is nearly there and hopes to begin manufacturing within the next two years. Ionic Materials is one of a new wave of academic and commercial research efforts in the United States,Europeand Asia to find safer battery technologies as consumers demand more performance from phones and cars. In the last year,Seeoand Sakti,rival United Statessolid polymer battery makers, have been acquired by the German industrial firm Bosch and the British vacuum maker Dyson.\n",
      "ESPN, one of Disneys most popular brands, has investors really worried:ESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when theratingscompany Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621,000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555,000 subscribers in December. The staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings.The challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The pay-TV industry as a whole has seen may consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services  or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether. \"There's an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"People don't want to pay for what they don't want to get.\" But ESPN remains one of the world's most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world's most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, MarvelStudiosand Pixar. ESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney's business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company's next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion.\n",

The metric it gave advertisers for their average video view time incorporated only the people who had watched the video long enough to count as a \"view\" in the first place, inflating the metric because it didnt count anyone who didnt watch, or watched for a shorter time. Facebooks stock fell more than 1.5 percent in extended trading after the miscalculation was earlier reported in the Wall Street Journal.

Big advertising buyers and marketers are upset about the inflated metric, and asked the company for more details, according to the report in the Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.

Qatalyst bankers go out and talk to a bunch of would-be acquirers and would-be investors but dont find a deal. So Postmates current investors decide to pony up a bunch of new money instead because, really, what is the alternative when youre backing a fast-growing but money-losing company that you think may still have home-run potentialThis means one of the following scenarios is true. Either A) Postmates thinks its business is more attractive than would-be acquirers or new investors do, or B) Qatalyst didnt do its job well, or C) both of the above.\n",

      "Whats Really Missing From the New iPhone: DazzleForget about the headphone jack for a second.Sure, its pretty annoying that Apples newest iPhones  the 7 and 7 Plus, which were unveiled in San Francisco on Wednesday and will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16  will not include a port for plugging in standard earbuds. But youll get used to it.The absence of a jack is far from the worst shortcoming in Apples latest product launch. Instead, its a symptom of a deeper issue with the new iPhones, part of a problem that afflicts much of the companys product lineup: Apples aesthetics have grown stale.Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apples best designs, what was iconic about the companys phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.This is a subjective assessment, and its one that Apple rebuts.Yet there are signs that my critique of Apples designs are shared by others. Industrial designers and tech critics used to swoon over Apples latest hardware; nowadays you witness less swooning and more bemusement.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apples big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing  exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.\n",

Other possible bidders include private equity firms that may want to take the company private, where it can solve some of its issues out of the public eye.But finding a buyer wont be easy, given the Twitters estimated cost. Using the same multiple LinkedIn got from Microsoft in its recent $26 billion acquisition deal, a Twitter buyer would have to fork over about $18 billion. Thats a steep price tag for a company that has had persistent issues with growth and also one that is still losing money each quarter.\n",
      "How Uber Drivers Decide How Long to Work:For nearly 20 years, economists have been debating how cabdrivers decide when to call it a day. This may seem like a trivial question, but it is one that cuts to the heart of whether humans are fundamentally rational  in this case, whether they earn their incomes efficiently  as the discipline has traditionally assumed.In one camp is a group of so-called behavioral economists who have found evidence that many taxi drivers work longer hours on days when business is slow and shorter hours when business is brisk  the opposite of what economic rationality, to say nothing of common sense, would seem to dictate.So who is right Thats where Uber comes in. When one of the companys researchers, using its supremely detailed data on drivers work time and rides, waded into the debate with a paper this year, the results were intriguing.Over all, there was little evidence that drivers were driving less when they could make more per hour than usual. But that was not true for a large portion of new drivers. Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.\n",
      "SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral - Destroying Facebook Satellite:A spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebooks reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company.The blast is likely to disrupt NASAs cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agencys growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and SolarCity, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. Theowner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the companys autopilot software, and SolarCity faces major financial challenges. The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity. Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his Facebook page that SpaceXs launch failure destroyed our satellite, a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong.\n",
      "EU hits Apple with $14.5 billion Irish tax demand:The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid.Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely.Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts.Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission's investigation could lead to \"material\" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place \"some amount of cash\" in an escrow account.Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others.As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax.\n",
      "Alphabets Legal Chief Steps Down From Uber Board:David Drummond, the chief legal officer at Alphabet Inc., has stepped down from Uber Technologies Inc.s board of directors as the two companies move further into each others territories.Drummond joined the board in 2013 when GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures, led a $258 million round of financing for Uber. It remains GVs largest investment, and the two companies worked together on projects, including the ability to call a car through Google Maps. However, relations between Alphabets Google unit and Uber have become strained in recent years. Bloomberg reported last year that Google had been working on a ride-hailing service using self-driving cars. Uber acquired Otto, an autonomous driving startup staffed by former Google employees, and is working with Volvo on driverless vehicles of its own, which the companies expect to begin rolling out in Pittsburgh this month. Uber has been developing its own mapping operation and is shooting street photography to create an alternative to Googles map data.\n",
      "Chinas Murky World Where E-Commerce Meets Student Lending:Across college campuses in China, a small army of marketers is recruiting students to borrow money at interest rates many times that charged by the nations banks.Those without a credit history or parental approval can borrow money to buy a smartphone, pay for holidays, or get the latest sneakers through a raft of apps such as Fenqile. The market leader, whose name literally means Happy Installment Payments, has 50,000 part-time marketers across more than 3,000 universities and proudly touts the slogan Wait no more; love what I love.Welcome to the regulatory gray area where peer-to-peer lending meets e-commerce in China.In the last three years, tens of millions of students have taken out micro-loans with the tap of a button to buy things. Once just the realm of startups, the sector has attracted heavy hitters in Chinas online industry, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s finance affiliate and JD.com Inc., which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the lending model. In a nation with 37 million college students, the market is expected to reach $15 billion, according to the Beijing-based market research firm Analysys. The apps sell everything from cameras to concert tickets sourced from third-parties, charging students annualized interest rates typically above 10 percent. The loans are then packaged and sold to wealthy individuals, who find the expected return of as much as 10 percent much more attractive than the central banks benchmark savings rate of 1.75 percent.\n"

WhatsApp to share user data with Facebook for ad targeting. Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsApp has announced a big change to its privacy policy which, once a user accepts its new T&Cs, will see it start to share some user data with its parent company  including for ad-targeting purposes on the latter service.[B]y coordinating more with Facebook, well be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp, WhatsApp writes in a blog on the change today.Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them. For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone youve never heard of.WhatsApp will also be sharing the data with the Facebook family of companies  so presumably its user data could also be fed to VR firm Oculus Rift, another Fb acquisition, and photo-sharing network Instagram.WhatsApp data that will be shared under the new T&Cs includes the phone number a user used to verify their account, and the last time they used the service.Two pieces of data which  on a creepiness scale of personal intel youd rather not hand over to a data-mining tech giant  are both right up there.\n",
      "Most Americans streamed the Olympics from PCs, not mobile devices.Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, accounted for almost 20 percent of the evening's Olympics stream. An additional 17 percent went to set-top boxes, such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Of these, Roku boxes were the overwhelming favorite among Olympics viewers, eating up a 10 percent share. In the end, however, PCs took the prize, accounting for more than 60 percent of consumption. Why is this so interesting Well, much of the narrative surrounding entertainment and technology these days has to do with mobile devices becoming a more dominant platform. Sandvine's data show that iPhones, Android devices and iPads account for almost one-third of general Internet consumption, much higher than what we see from the chart above.Analysts say this discrepancy highlights the particular way in which Americans could access their Olympics coverage online. To watch the Internet live stream, viewers needed to log in through their cable subscription. The downside to this meant being chained to a cable provider, but the upside was that once you authenticated you could watch from any device  mobile or otherwise. Although much of our media consumption is increasingly shifting toward mobile devices, live-stream events such as the Olympics may be one area where PCs could remain dominant for some time.\n",

      "Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success: It is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces  but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Lyfts discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing companys largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.\n",

Those moves are the most recent indications of Ubers ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.And they come after Ford Motors announcement this week that it would put fleets of self-driving taxis onto American roads in five years. As part of that effort, Ford said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. Ford also announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles.

      "Pinterest Follows Rivals Into Selling Video Ads:Pinterest is finally taking the plunge that many other tech companies already have: It has started selling video advertising.Video ads from brands like Kate Spade and bareMinerals will start appearing in the virtual scrapbook-like Pinterest feed on Wednesday and into the coming weeks, and Pinterest is hopeful that ads from other brands will soon follow.The new ads will show up in a silent, GIF-like format within Pinterests feed, and will play with sound once clicked. Users will be able to click images, or pins, of featured products next to the videos. That could, for instance, bring them to a brands website or allow them to buy the product without leaving Pinterest.The move puts the social-bookmarking site in competition with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as large digital publishers, which are all vying for the increasingly large amounts of marketers digital ad dollars.Pinterest allows people to save links to images and videos, known as pins, to aesthetically pleasing virtual bulletin boards, and to follow the boards created by others. It has become a popular destination for consumers looking to buy goods, particularly in areas like home improvement and cooking, and for the brands looking to reach them. Pinterest says 75 percent of the content people consume on its site comes from businesses.Pinterest, which says it has more than 100 million visitors a month, has largely been absent from conversations about videos, even as such content has boomed in popularity on its site. The company said it had seen a 60 percent increase in the number of videos saved by users in the last year.Last year, Etsy was the website with the greatest number of links from Pinterests Save button. Now, it is YouTube. Candidly, the company just in general has underinvested until now in video as a platform, Jon Kaplan, the head of global sales at Pinterest, said in an interview. We wanted to make sure it was customized and specific to the way people use our platform. What youre going to see going forward is a very big investment in video.\n"

The employees that are being retrenched are located across a dozen cities and are being given three months salary as compensation, said the people mentioned above. These include current and former employees of the cab hailing company.Ola had acquired smaller rival TaxiForSure for $200 million in early 2015 to strengthen its position against Uber Technologies Inc.After the acquisition, Ola had centralized TaxiForSures operations to three major citiesMumbai, Bengaluru and Delhiand eight smaller cities. The company kept around 250 employees each in the three metros and around 30 each in the eight other cities. The layoff and shutdown comes at a time when Ola is locked in a bruising battle with Uber that involved public spats and legal wrangling. It is also dealing with adverse regulatory environment in various states that affect its operations.The company has been trying for a large fundraise for quite some time. Ola has so far raised around $1.2 billion from investors including Japans SoftBank Group Corp. The taxi-hailing firm was valued around $5 billion at the time of its last fundraising.Although Ola had initially planned to retain TaxiForSure as a separate brand, resource crunch seems to have forced the company to wind down the unit. The people cited above said that drivers on TaxiForSure have been moved to the Ola platform. The company has also been prompting TaxiForSure users to migrate to the Ola app in recent months.\n",

That made the company the fourth-largest competitor in the market behind Huawei, OPPO and Vivo. Xiaomi was once valued at $46 billion, according to CB Insights.The Chinese market has grown increasingly competitive as domestic manufacturers have improved their quality, design and marketing, putting pressure on global leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Apple saw shipments in China drop 32 percent in the second quarter and the iPhone maker fell to fifth in the market, according to IDC.The research firm said that Huawei and OPPO gained ground by concentrating on one or two key attributes in their marketing messages. Huawei emphasized the Leica lens now available on its phones, while OPPO pitched fast-charging technology.Apples global shipments are set to decline in 2016 as it continues to lose ground in its largest overseas market, Canalys said in a separate report.The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging.

      "Alibaba passes earnings milestones, silent on SEC probe:China's Alibaba Group Holding posted its best revenue growth since before the e-commerce titan's listing in late 2014, lifting its shares to their highest level in a year. But Alibaba was silent on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into its accounting practices, which have long been the subject of criticism. In the three months to June 30, Alibaba also made more money from mobile shopping than from PCs for the first time, helping to send its shares up by more than 5 percent to $92.10 in New York, its highest level in more than a year.\"This is a decoupling of revenue from GMV (gross merchandise volume),\" he said, referring to a measure of the total value of goods transacted on Alibaba's online shopping platforms. Despite GMV growth remaining low compared to previous years, rising 24 percent to 837 billion yuan, Alibaba is squeezing more money out of its e-commerce business, chiefly from advertising. That translated to quarterly revenues of 32.15 billion yuan ($4.84 billion), a 59 percent leap from the previous year and the highest growth rate since late 2013. While China e-commerce was strong for Alibaba in its first quarter, the company is also investing in other businesses including cloud computing arm Aliyun, driverless vehicles and online shopping in Southeast Asia. It hopes these can become an eventual source of growth as Alibaba faces the prospect of a saturated online retail market in China. Although some are showing promise - Aliyun sales rose 156 percent, though only contributed 4 percent of total revenue - most are still loss-making.\n",

Didi and Uber have raised and spent billions of dollars in a discount slugfest to win drivers, passengers and market share in China.Didi, now worth around $35 billion, last year invested about $30 million in Ola, which is also backed by Japan's SoftBank Group, and the two are allies in an anti-Uber group that also includes U.S.-based Lyft and Southeast Asia-focused Grab.\"This (Didi/Uber China) deal changes the dynamics of how they (Didi) will invest in India,\" said the person, who didn't want to be named because the discussions were private.

SoftBank Capital, Ola's key investor, faces its own financial issues and is selling assets to raise cash and reduce debt, which may pose another fundraising challenge for Ola, which was aiming to raise another $1 billion this year.After the Didi deal, Uber is even more focused on India, which it has previously called its No. 2 priority overseas market, doubling down on resources, staffing and technology deployed there, said two people familiar with Uber's plans, one of whom is based in the United States.\n",
      "Airbnb raising a reported $850M at a $30B valuation:Almost a year after its last raise of $1.6 billion, the company is said to be adding $850 million to its coffers, according to information obtained by Equidate.While $850 million is a ton of cash, it is not the largest round the company has raised. Last year, the company raised $1.5 billion in one of the largest VC rounds in history. The additional capital would only move Airbnb from the fifth to the forth most valuable tech unicorn at a potential valuation of $30 billion (tear). Even as a late-stage company, Airbnb has to be increasingly conscious of the capital it takes on. Too much equity dilutes early investors, while too much debt could put investors at risk if valuations were to suddenly tank. Debt as an asset class is paid off before equity.Airbnb has notoriously taken actions to strategically prolong an IPO, bringing on a $1 billion credit faculty last year to support growth without diluting investors.The company previously had an approximate valuation of $27 billion, so while the round is large, it doesnt deviate from prior anti-dilution strategies. With respect to deals that Airbnb reportedly walked away from, the $850 million dollar deal is tame. The Wall Street Journalreported that Airbnb left money on the table, rejecting a deal that would have valued the company at $34 billion.\n"

The introduction from Connie Chan, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, to Chinas largest ride-hailing company led to a $100 million investment and partnership.Behind the scenes of an unprecedented flood of capital from China into Silicon Valley over the past two years is an elite network of brokers. These brokers do more than deal-making; they play anthropologist and cultural translator -- from coaching startup founders about the culturally appropriate place to sit at a conference room table in China to breaking down how emojis are used in Chinese apps. Their acumen is growing more valuable, entrepreneurs say, as they navigate a cast of hard-to-parse characters with alluring deep pockets and promises of big business opportunities overseas.She is the whisperer between China and Silicon Valley, said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a web security startup, of Chang. Last year, Chang helped Prince -- whose company had given up on China in 2011 -- clinch a partnership with Baidu, Chinas search giant. Theres very few that really understand both sides.Chang, who was born in Nanjing, China, came to the States to seek a doctorate in Modern Chinese History. She got pulled into tech industry after graduating from Stanford Law School in the early 1990s, when she got a job as an associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the Silicon Valley firm known for its ties to the clubby venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road.One of her early clients was Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese investor who founded the Japanese telcommunications giant Softbank.

      "Tesla misses Q2 earnings, delivers 14,402 vehicles:Tesla missed its Q2 earnings targets today in a report released after the close of the market. Tesla executives are not wavering on yearly targets, despite a slower than expected quarter. All of this comes amidst a seemingly never-ending wave of Tesla headlines dominating Silicon Valley over the last few weeks.The energy company born out of an automobile company reported non-GAAP Q2 revenue of $1.56 billion up from last years Q2 revenue of $1.2 billion. The company came close but ultimately missed analyst estimates of $1.6 billion.Tesla closed down 0.62 percent today at $225.79. After the news was released, Tesla shares moved up almost instantly in after-hours trading after the news dropped but have been fluctuating up and down by 2 percent since.Wall Street analysts expected an adjusted net loss of $52 cents a share but found themselves with a worse than expected loss of $1.06 per share.Tesla delivered 14,402 new vehicles consisting of 9,764 Model S and 4,638 Model X in Q2, slightly ahead of last months estimates.Tesla had originally aimed to deliver 80,000 vehicles by the end of the year. It is growing tougher by the day for the company to hit that goal. On the bright side, the company noted that almost half of Q2 production occurred in the final four weeks of the quarter.

Facebook is working on adding the ability to hail rides and make payments within its Messenger app. Facebook and Twitter have begun live-streaming video.All of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.WeChat and Alipay, two Chinese apps, have long used the bar-codelike symbols  called QR codes  to let people pay for purchases and transfer money. Both let users hail a taxi or order a pizza without switching to another app. The video-streaming service YY.com has for years made online stars of young Chinese people posing, chatting and singing in front of video cameras at home.Silicon Valley has long been the worlds tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valleys footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.But Chinas tech industry  particularly its mobile businesses  has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.Chinas largest internet companies are the only ones in the world that rival Americas in scale. The purchase this week of Uber China by Didi Chuxing after a protracted competition shows that at least domestically, Chinese players can take on the most sophisticated and largest start-ups coming out of America.Industry leaders point to a number of areas where China jumped first. Before the online dating app Tinder, people in China used an app called Momo to flirt with nearby singles. Before the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos discussed using drones to deliver products, Chinese media reported that a local delivery company, S.F. Express, was experimenting with the idea. WeChat offered speedier in-app news articles long before Facebook, developed a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made major use of QR codes well before Snapchat.Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\n",

A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Ubers ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.Under the terms of the deal, the new companys estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxings $28 billion valuation and Uber Chinas $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.Didi Chuxing would also make a $1 billion investment in the companys operations in the rest of the world, called Uber Global, which was lastvalued at $62.5 billion, according to the two people with knowledge of the sale.

It now has more than 1.7 billion monthly users, well ahead of any rivals.Its shares were up 5.4 percent in after-hours trading at $130.01, after hitting their highest since the company went public in 2012.Mobile advertising revenue accounted for 84 percent of the company's total advertising revenue, compared with 76 percent a year earlier.Total advertising revenue surged 63 percent to $6.24 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.80 billion.Meanwhile, Facebook still has several untapped areas for revenue opportunities, including its WhatsApp and Messenger apps, both of which have more than 1 billion users. But Wehner said the company does not plan to monetize them any time soon, and that it is instead focused on building interactions between businesses and users on the apps.Facebook also owns picture-sharing app Instagram, which recently announced it has more than 500 million users. Facebook has yet to say how much money Instagram makes, but research firm eMarketer predicts it will make $1.5 billion in revenue this year.Total revenue rose 59.2 percent to $6.44 billion, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $6.02 billion.\n",
      "Apple sells more iPhones than expected, shares jump after hours despite revenue drop:Apple Inc (AAPL.O) sold more iPhones than Wall Street expected in the third quarter and estimated its revenue in the current period would top many analysts' targets, soothing fears that demand for the company's most important product had hit a wall. Its shares rose 7 percent in after-hours trading. The world's most valuable publicly traded company said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in the third quarter, down 15 percent from the year-ago quarter but slightly more than the average analyst forecast of 40.02 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. IPhone sales dropped for the second straight quarter, pushing down Apple's total revenue 14.6 percent in the fiscal third quarter, ended June 25. Demand for Apple's phones has waned in China, partly because of economic uncertainty there, and has also slowed in more mature markets as people tend to hold on to their phones for longer. The sales slump has stoked concerns about whether the tech leader can continue to deliver profits at the level Wall Street has come to expect. \"China was a major letdown,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"Samsung and Huawei are much more competitive now than a year ago and the Chinese economy is not doing well at all.\" Apple's services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and other services, generated nearly $6 billion in revenue, up 18.9 percent from the previous year.As iPhone sales level off, Apple is attempting to use such services to wring more revenue out of its existing base of users. The business emerged as Apples second largest after the iPhone for the first time in the second quarter, eclipsing gadgets such as the iPad and the Mac.That shift bodes well for Apple because gross margins on services are better than the average for the rest of the company, Maestri said.\n"

      "Amazon Expands Drone Testing in Britain:Amazon has partnered with the British government to significantly expand drone testing, a move that could allow the devices to deliver packages to British homes far earlier than in the United States.Under the partnership, Britains aviation regulator will let Amazon test several aspects of drone technology  such as piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of its operators  that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States has not permitted. The tests, which are an important sign of confidence in Britain after its historic vote last month to leave the European Union, are to begin immediately.The move puts pressure on the F.A.A., which had recently rebuffed requests by Amazon, Google and other drone makers to advance their delivery plans. The tech behemoths and other drone makers have aggressively lobbied the F.A.A. to authorize the devices to significantly reduce costs to transport goods by airplane, freight and trucks.Amazon said it hoped success with the drone trials in Britain would encourage more hesitant regulators in the United States and elsewhere to loosen restrictions. The trials will help identify what operating rules and safety regulations will be needed to help move the drone industry forward, the company said in a statement.Amazon will work with British regulators to test drones that fly beyond the line of sight of operators in rural and suburban areas. It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people.\n",
      "Verizon to Pay $4.8 Billion for Yahoos Core Business:the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterdays great idea, and on Sunday, Yahoo reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company agreed to sell Yahoos core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.Thats a pittance compared with Yahoos peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000. Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.But Yahoo, despite constant management turmoil, kept growing. Started as a directory of websites, the company was soon doing much more, offering searches, email, shopping and news. Those services, which were free to consumers, were supported by advertising displayed on its various pages.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed like every company in America  and across much of the world  wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured in to Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival was a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancy, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Verizon, one of the nations biggest telecommunications companies, plans to combine Yahoos operations with AOL, a longtime Yahoo competitor acquired by Verizon last year. The idea is to use Yahoos vast array of content and its advertising technology to offer more robust services to Verizon customers and advertisers.\n",
      "Startup Deal Activity Keeps Falling Worldwide:According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, global deal activity for venture capital-backed startups continued a decline in the second quarter after hitting record levels one year ago. In fact, at the current rate, deal activity will just barely top 2013s numbers.\"Many of the high-profile tech [initial public offerings] from 2015 continue to trade well below their initial offering price, putting pressure on private company valuations,\" said Brian Hughes of KPMG. \"This, combined with economic concerns in China and Europe, has continued to put a damper on VC investment.\"\"It's a challenging time for VC investors,\" he concluded.The reason funding moved higher while deal activity dropped is that some larger startups such as those of Snapchat Inc., Didi Chuxing, and Uber Technologies Inc. all saw huge rounds, accounting for much of the funding. In fact, in North America, Uber and Snapchat accounted for more than $4.5 billion of the $17.1 billion in total investment.And while there might have been more billion dollar companies minted in the second quarter than in the first, there were yet again more \"down events\"companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuationthan there were unicorns created. According to the report, seven startups reached the unicorn club in the past four months, but CB Insights downround tracker shows that 17 failed to live up to expectations and experienced down events over that time. Unicorn creation saw its most recent peak in the third quarter of last year, when 25 were birthed.\n",
      "Dollar Shave Club hit the jackpot when Unilever agreed to buy the online men's razor merchant for $1 billion.Other e-commerce startups such as Birchbox and Stitch Fix can't necessarily expect their own suitor to sweep in with such sweet deals. That's because the key to Dollar Shave Club's appeal is not so much its online prowess but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years. Dollar Shave Club upended the industry's traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). The day Dollar Shave Club started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, \"so gentle a toddler could use it.\" The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. The video has been viewed about 23 million times. The company reached $150 million-plus in sales in 2015, Unilever said in a press release announcing the deal. That despite the fact that the blades lack many of Gillette's high-tech enhancements. Few other e-commerce startups can claim to have built a brand so quickly. Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, mostly offline, but they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel.\n",
      "Microsoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business:On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable  a trade-off for slimmer margins.After Microsofts misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.Without the deferral, Microsofts revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion.The companys shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.\n",
      "Netflix Disappoints Wall Street as Subscriber Growth Slows:Netflix isnt looking so invincible anymore.On Monday, the company disappointed Wall Street with the news that subscriber growth for its streaming video service had slowed significantly during the second quarter. Also disconcerting was that Netflix added far fewer subscribers over all during the period than expected, which the company blamed on news media coverage of its plans for price increases.Netflix added just 1.7 million new streaming members in the three months that ended June 30, about half the 3.3 million net additions from the same period the previous year. That anemic growth  for both United States and international subscribers  came in well below its forecast of 2.5 million new members.The development sent Netflix shares down as much as 16 percent in after-hours trading on Monday, representing the second earnings report in a row that has sparked a double-digit plunge in the companys stock price. Mr. Hastings finds himself in a starkly different position from just six months ago, when he stood onstage at the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas and declared that Netflix would conquer the global market for streaming television, adding more than 130 countries to its world service map.At the time, the companys share had been soaring, surging 135 percent in 2015 as the top performer on the Standard & Poors 500-stock index.So far this year, Netflixs share price has declined about 14 percent. Still, some analysts pointed to the companys financials as proof that it would continue to deliver on its plans in the long term. Net income for the quarter was $41 million, up 58 percent from $26 million during the same period last year. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 27 percent from $1.6 billion in the same period last year.\n",
      "SoftBank is bidding to buy ARM for $32 billion  because everythings a computer now:apans SoftBank is buying U.K.-based chip design firm ARM Holdings for about $32 billion, according to the FT.Why Everything is a computer now, and ARM has been one of the winners of the mobile revolution.ARM designs chips  but doesnt actually make them  for a huge variety of devices. It dominates the market for smartphones  Apple is a big client, as is Samsung  and its chips shows up in other consumer gadgets, as well as more-industrial-like devices and internet of things sensors.The number of chips containing ARM processors reached almost 15 billion in 2015, up from about 6 billion in 2010.The move is a big one for SoftBank CEO Masa Son after his would-be successor, former Google executive Nikesh Arora, stepped away from the company last month. (Talks presumably started while Arora was still there.)One key question is whether other firms will let SoftBank purchase ARM or if there will be a bidding war. Apple, arguably ARMs most important client, and Intel, which lost the mobile chip war to ARM, are both potential buyers.\n"

      "Line Rises in Initial Public Offering, Cheering Skittish Tech Industry:The Line Corporation, the owner of a Japanese instant messaging app with a colorful cast of cartoon characters, cheered the technology industry on Thursday when its shares jumped 30 percent in their American trading debut.The strong showing offers hope for tech firms and their financial backers that Wall Street investors are warming up to closely held technology start-ups. But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales  something that many new tech companies lack.Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable.Lines American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday.Lines debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poors 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britains decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.\n",
      "Pokemon GO gets ads - could be next big marketing tool for retailers:Pokemon GO, a mobile game that has rocketed to the top of Apple Inc and Android app stores in record time, looks set to challenge young internet companies which specialize in increasing foot traffic for small businesses and may end up playing a role in major brands' marketing, according to industry experts.The augmented reality game from Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd, where players walk around real-life neighborhoods to hunt down virtual cartoon characters on their smartphone screens, has more than 65 million users in the United States just seven days after launch.That is more users than Twitter Inc, and the game is already helping local restaurants, coffee shops and small retailers to attract new customers.L'inizio Pizza Bar in Long Island City in New York claims its sales jumped 75 percent over the weekend by activating a \"lure module\" feature that attracts virtual Pokemon characters to the store, thereby tempting in nearby players. The store's manager spent $10 to have a dozen Pokemon characters placed in the location, according to a report in the New York Post.That sort of instant effect is a potential threat for Groupon Inc, LivingSocial Inc, Foursquare and other relatively new companies which have revolutionized online marketing for small businesses in the last few years.\n",
      "EU-U.S. commercial data transfer pact enters into force:A new commercial data pact between the European Union and the United States entered into force on Tuesday, ending months of uncertainty over cross-border data flows, and companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft can sign up from Aug. 1.The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will give businesses moving personal data across the Atlantic - from human resources information to people's browsing histories to hotel bookings - an easy way to do so without falling foul of tough EU data transferral rules.The previous such framework, Safe Harbour, was struck down by the EU's top court in October on the grounds that it allowed U.S. agents too much access to Europeans' data.Revelations three years ago from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance practices caused political outrage in Europe and stoked mistrust of big U.S. tech companies.In the months that followed the EU ruling companies have had to rely on other more cumbersome mechanisms for legally transferring data to the United States.The Privacy Shield will underpin over $250 billion dollars of transatlantic trade in digital services annually.Google and Microsoft said they would sign up to the Privacy Shield and would work with European data protection authorities in case of inquiries.A person familiar with social network Facebook's thinking said the company had not yet decided whether to sign up.\n",
      "The non-gamers guide to playing Pokemon Go:Pokemon Go is a full-blown phenomenon, with millions of downloads and excitement only growing after players got through their first weekend of being real-life Pokemon trainers. The game is heavy on fun but light on explanations -- particularly if you're so excited to start playing that you blitz through the opening tutorial.So maybe you've downloaded it, fired it up and then gotten, well, completely lost. If you're completely mystified by how this game actually works, here are some basics to get you out there and catching Pokemon in no time.Once you download the app, you'll be asked to sign in. You can sign in using an existing Google account. Or, if you're not so keen to connect your Pokemon identity to your Google identity, then you can also sign up with the Pokemon Trainer Club, which is an account with the Pokemon Co. From there, you design your character and pick your first Pokemon. Then you can get going!And you will have to actually get going. The whole selling point of the game is to walk around the real world to find the cute little critters. This not only encourages you to explore your own city, but also -- gasp! -- gets you outside and around other people. In fact, this is not really a game you can play while stationary. Sometimes Pokemon will come to you, but more often than not you have to go to them.\n",
      "What is Pokmon Go and why is everybody talking about it:This new Pokmon game is bringing augmented reality mainstream.Its a new mobile game, free on both iOS and Android, that lets you create an avatar that can catch, train, trade and battle Pokmon characters inside the game. That sounds familiar. Isnt that the premise of virtually every other Pokmon gameYes, kinda. What makes this game unique is that it uses your phones location services and camera so that you can catch Pokmon in real life. That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game. So finding new Pokmon and checkpoints for the game actually requires you to get off the couch and walk down the block.How does this workThe game uses Google Maps technology to place your avatar on a virtual world that mirrors your real life surroundings. When you find a Pokmon, the game uses augmented reality (AR) to make it look like whatever Pokmon youve stumbled across is indeed standing right there in front of you. Who created Pokmon GoNintendo and the other creators of Pokmon teamed up with Niantic Labs to create the game. The former company was born inside Google; its founder, John Hanke, was a key leader of its Geo products (Google Maps, Earth). After moving to leave Google in 2010, Hanke was lured to stay with funding for Niantic, a skunkworks project to build mobile AR tools using Google Maps technology. Niantics first effort, Ingress  an augmented-reality, massively multiplayer, location-based online game  cultivated a small but very dedicated following. Niantic spun out of Google in the fall, yet the search giant stayed involved, participating in a $30 million investment for developing Pokmon Go.\n",

Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. facilitated the deal. Creditors will receive about a 5 percent yield on the loan, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the terms arent public.\n",
      "India's $4 Smartphone Seems Too Good to Be True:A little-known Indian company called Ringing Bells Pvt is set to start shipping the Freedom 251. The prototype touts a quad-core processor, a 4-inch screen and front and back cameras - at the astonishingly low price of 251 rupees (less than $4).While global brands Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. sell devices for less than $100, the $4 smartphone is the one stirring up the internet-hungry, app-crazy hordes in a country where Apple Inc. has been unable to make a dent. With iPhones costing upwards of $700, Apple commands a mere 2 percent market share in a country where the World Bank puts the per capita income at $5,630.Brands can't make money even on $50 smartphones, so profiting from a $4 device is a ludicrous idea, say experts like Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. While Micromax sells millions of cheap devices every month in smaller cities - it profits by taking advantage of economies of scale. Ringing Bells managing director Mohit Goel isn't counting on a profit from device sales, conceding that the company will lose hundreds of rupees on each unit, and is instead planning to recoup money through advertising and marketing deals. Goel has said the company is importing kits from Taiwan and assembling the phones in a factory in Haridwar near Delhi.Even at $4, the smartphone could still be out of reach for most because of scarcity. When Goel first announced Freedom 251 in February, the company said over 70 million jostled to register, crashing its website. Last week he said Ringing Bells will soon start shipping 200,000 smartphones to buyers picked by lottery. Other details were not available and e-mails, phone calls and text messages to Goel and his representatives in the past days went unanswered.Selling such a cheap device has attracted scrutiny along with the publicity. The prototype Freedom 251 presented to the media turned out to be produced by another manufacturer with its logos covered. Thwarted buyers protested outside the companys headquarters, setting off inquiries by the police and tax officials.Pankaj Mahindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association, with members including Apple and Samsung, said We are concerned and keeping a close watch.\n"

      "Samsung Set to Boost Spending as S7 Revives Smartphone Fortunes:After ending a two-year smartphone slide with the Galaxy S7, Samsung Electronics Co. could be about to hike capital spending to sustain a revival across the company.At least $5 billion more of investment is headed to the display and semiconductor businesses, according to a survey of analyst estimates, to help Samsung ride out bumps in the phone market. Such a move reflects new optimism about the company after the success of the Galaxy S7, with the shares rallying 17 percent this year.Samsungs smartphone business has finally had a soft landing after a bumpy ride, said Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Seoul. Samsung will probably boost spending on memory and displays, which are poised for a sudden rise as the next growth drivers.But with growth in the global smartphone market evaporating, it needs to build up its other major businesses as competitors bring out new products in an attempt to spark growth.\n",
      "How AWS came to be:There are lots of stories about the formation of AWS, but this much we know: 10 years ago,Amazon Web Services, the cloud Infrastructure as a Service arm of Amazon.com, was launched with little fanfare as a side business for Amazon.com. Today, its a highly successful company in its own right, riding a remarkable $10 billion run rate. What you may not know is that the roots for the idea of AWS go back to the 2000 timeframe when Amazon was a far different company than it is today  simply an e-commerce company struggling with scale problems. Those issues forced the company to build some solid internal systems to deal with the hyper growth it was experiencing  and that laid the foundation for what would become AWS.Speaking recently at an event in Washington, DC, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, who has been there from the beginning, explained how these core systems developed out of need over a three-year period beginning in 2000, and, before they knew it, without any real planning, they had the makings of a business that would become AWS. It began way back in the 2000 timeframe when the company wanted to launch an e-commerce service called Merchant.com to help third-party merchants like Target or Marks & Spencer build online shopping sites on top of Amazons e-commerce engine. It turned out to be a lot harder than they thought to build an external development platform, because, like many startups, when it launched in 1994, it didnt really plan well for future requirements. Instead of an organized development environment, they had unknowingly created a jumbled mess. That made it a huge challenge to separate the various services to make a centralized development platform that would be useful for third parties.At that point, the company took its first step toward building the AWS business by untangling that mess into a set of well-documented APIs. While it drove the smoother development of Merchant.com, it also served the internal developer audience well, too, and it set the stage for a much more organized and disciplined way of developing tools internally going forward.\n",
      "Zenefits halves its previous valuation to $2B to head off investor lawsuits:Zenefits is executing a change in its current ownership structure that will increase the overall ownership of the company for late-stage investors; its a move that revalues the companys Series C round at $2 billion and looks to placate investor concerns over the companys regulatory investigations.As part of accepting the new ownership changes, the investors participating will sign a release of claims against the company. Its another move that new CEO David Sacks is doing in whats been a massive cleanup effort of the company following report after report of the company skirting insurance regulation. Since all those regulatory issues came to light, the company has laid off more than 350 employees and parted ways with its former CEO Parker Conrad. The biggest issue stemmed from a program called The Macro that would aid in circumventing state licensing requirements.All this is basically a way to reset expectations for investors, as well as try to retain employees following the changes in the companys ownership structure. Shareholders were kept in the dark in relation to the existence and use of The Macro, which required a reset of the relationship. Zenefits grew like a rocket ship, reaching a $4.5 billion valuation in just about two years after the company started. That, at the time, labeled the company as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups ever  but, obviously, there was a bunch of shady stuff going on behind the scenes to pad that growth.\n",
      "Facebook to Change News Feed to Focus on Friends and Family:For years, Facebook has courted publishers of all sizes, asking them to depend more and more on the social media giant to expand their audiences. Now, Facebook has a new message for publishers: Tamp down your expectations.Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to make a series of changes to its news feed algorithm so that it will more favorably promote content posted by the friends and family of users.The side effect of those changes, the company said, is that content posted by publishers will show up less prominently in news feeds, resulting in significantly less traffic to the hundreds of news media sites that have come to rely on Facebook.The move underscores the never-ending algorithm-tweaking that Facebook undertakes to maintain interest in its news feed, the companys marquee feature that is seen by more than 1.65 billion users every month.It is also a reminder that while Facebook is vastly important to the long-term growth of news media companies, from older outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post to upstarts like BuzzFeed, Vice and Vox Media, publishers rank lower on Facebooks list of priorities.\n",
      "Lyft Tells Investors to Expect No Growth in Rides for June:Lyft Inc. may be hitting a wall in its war with its richer competitor.Lyft told investors in a recent memo obtained by Bloomberg that it expects the number of rides it handles to be flat or down in June, compared with May. That follows a record month for rides in May.Lyft expects to beat its target for second-quarter ride volume by 35 percent, Lyft told its investors. \"This implies June will be flat to slightly down from the record May level given we face traditional seasonality headwinds in June as most college students leave their campuses for the summer,\" the note said. \"Additionally, June represents the first full month without Austin, after pausing operations in the city in May.\" (Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin, Texas, after the city passed legislation that would require them to conduct fingerprinted background checks on their drivers.) One Lyft investor told Bloomberg that, given the companys heavy losses, if Lyft could sell itself for $5.5 billion -- the value of the company at its latest valuation -- that would be an acceptable price. Qatalyst could also help the startup sell a stake, rather than the whole business.The company also said in the memo that it reached a nearly $1.9 billion annual revenue run rate based on its performance in May. In November, it touted a $1 billion run rate. Revenue run rates apply monthly figures to a 12-month period. Investors use them to gauge the potential for growing businesses.While Lyft expects to lose hundreds of millions this year, Uber has lost money on a much larger scale. In three quarters last year Uber lost $1.7 billion. The company has committed to spending billions in China and India, and Uber has continued to subsidize rides against its global competitors like Didi Chuxing and Ola. Like Lyft, as a private company, Ubers financials are private.\n",

Lyft and Qatalyst declined to comment.The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the hiring, said Quattrone has contacted large automakers about buying a stake in Lyft. In January, Lyft said General Motors invested $500 million into the San Francisco company.Lyft, which was last valued at $5.5 billion, has been overshadowed by Uber. While Lyft only operates in the U.S., it has teamed up with Chinas Didi Chuxing and other global ride-hailing companies to form an alliance to take on Uber.\n",
      "Brexit Pounds Some Technology Companies:Online marketplace operator EBay sank as much as 8.2 percent on Friday, outpacing declines by the wider U.S. equity market as analysts singled it out for its large exposure to the U.K. and Germany. Chipmaker ARM, based in Cambridge, U.K., gained as much as 6.8 percent on calculations that a weaker British pound will make its repatriated earnings more valuable.The pound sank more than 8 percent against the U.S. currency Friday, to its lowest level in 30 years. The U.S. dollar rose 2 percent against a basket of foreign currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A strong dollar hurts mainly when proceeds from goods and services sold in foreign currencies are exchanged into dollars. That can also make it more expensive to buy U.S. tech products.EBay has the most significant exposure among U.S. internet companies to the U.K. and Europe, according a report by Needham & Co. The disruption caused by Britains exit from the EU and currency fluctuations could slow cross-border transactions on online marketplaces.\"EBay gets 31 percent of revenue from U.K. and Germany, more than Google or Amazon,\" said Needham analyst Kerry Rice. \"This really impacts cross-border trade more than anything. It could shift spending behavior if currency fluctuations make a purchase cost-prohibitive.\" ARM investors were quick to turn to its own calculations on the impact of currency moves and bet on an increase in profit. The company, which licenses chip technology and designs, gets more than a third of its sales from the U.S., 19 percent from China and another 25 percent from Taiwan and South Korea. Singapore and Switzerland supply it with more revenue than its home market at around 3 percent each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.According to a company presentation from April, more than 95 percent of ARMs sales are in dollars. A 10 percent move in the value of the pound against the dollar moves earnings per share by 15 percent, it said. That suggests the recent drop in the British currency could boost profit by about 10 percent for the rest of this year.\n"

      "Twilio, a Cloud-Based Business, Soars After Its IPO:Shares of Twilio, a maker of software that helps companies like Uber and Nordstrom communicate with their customers, soared 92 percent on Thursday, their first day of trading after becoming the largest technology initial public offering of stock so far this year.Twilio began trading in a market that has not been receptive to tech initial offerings. Only three technology companies have made their debuts so far in 2016.The company said on Wednesday that it had raised $150 million, pricing 10 million shares at $15 each, above the range it marketed to investors. The I.P.O. price yielded a market valuation of $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.1 billion valuation Twilio received in a private funding round a year ago.Twilio, based in San Francisco, has been hailed as a trailblazer compared with the almost 170 unicorns  companies with valuations above $1 billion  that have chosen to stay private for now. Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software companys finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets became more uncertain, investors preferred that companies going public turn a profit.Twilio had $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.\n",
      "Clash of Clans May Spur Tencents Marvel-Like Aspirations:Tencent is spending $8.6 billion to gain control of Supercell Oy -- the Finnish maker of mobile games including Hay Day, Clash Royale and Boom Beach -- from SoftBank Group Corp. To see how that portfolio may fit into Tencents emerging entertainment empire, look at how the Chinese company leveraged World of Warcraft and League of Legends into global powerhouses.League of Legends 67 million monthly users helped Tencent earn $9 billion in game revenue last year, and the Tencent-backed movie Warcraft is setting box-office records in China since this months release. Acquiring Supercell reinforces Tencents entertainment aspirations against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., and comes after Tencent bought the rights to 300-plus Japanese anime franchises in a push to become a worldwide multimedia brand like Marvel, DC and Disney.Tencent has taken on a strategy to convert good IPs into movies and anime, said Mark Tanner, founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. Its creating a world of superhero characters for entertainment.Supercell occupied the top spot on researcher App Annies rankings of publishers fortwo years running. Clash of Clans was named an essential app by Apple Inc. and was promoted during the 2015 Super Bowl in a commercial featuring Academy Award-nominee Liam Neeson. Yet the game hasnt been among the 10 top-grossing apps in China and Japans iOS Store since 2015, which is where Tencents clout can help.The companys QQ and WeChat instant messaging apps have more than a billion users combined, and it could use those apps to promote Supercell games, Tanner said. That distribution system helped Tencents mobile-game revenue increase 16 percent to 8.2 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in the quarter ending March 31, compared with the previous three months. Chinas mobile gaming market expected to reach 68.8 billion yuan by 2018.We do see theres an opportunity for IPs of games and movies and video to cross and splice with each other, in the right way, Martin Lau, Tencents president, said during a conference call Tuesday.\n",

      "VR is the future of porn, and its a creepy future indeed:This got real weird, real fast. And not just because I was demoing the technology in the middle of the E3 floor, surrounded by fellow show-goers. Its just  well, even after all the explainers in the world, its hard to sufficiently brace your mind for all that virtual reality porn entails.It occupied a small space, tucked in the rear of the LA Convention Center, but Naughty America may just have had the one booth capable of rivaling Nintendos for sheer show buzz. We must have walked by the thing a dozen times during our three days on the floor, and there was always a small army of show-goers lined up to take it for a spin.Much like, say, your standard first-person shooter, the technology is built around a POV (point-of-view) shot, putting the viewer in the place of the camera. The effect is already a bit jolting (and, at times nausea-inducing) in standard VR, but all of that really goes next level when you look down and youve swapped your bits and bobs with someone elses.The companys demo cycles through a few short clips, in which the scenery, scenarios and co-stars change, but, well, the view pretty much stays the same. Its hard to say how much of the initial shock is due to the newness of the technology and how much is firmly entrenched in the uncanny valley, though the company told me that many attendees enjoyed the demo, strange setting and all.Once you get past the somewhat off-putting nature of swapping nether regions with a professional, VR porn does offer an interesting way forward for an industry that, like many others, has been hard hit by the prevalence of free online content.\n",
      "Phone Tracking, Nude Selfie IOUs See Chinese Bare All for Credit:Talkative people pay back loans. The very talkative default. Too taciturn is no good either. Also, dont take out a loan at 4 a.m.Those are lessons from online lenders in China that are tracking peoples behavior -- via apps on their mobile phones -- and taking it into account when deciding what their credit ratings should be. Chinese consumers dont mind handing over personal details that would spark outrage in the West, in exchange for lower interest rates. WeLab Ltd., a Hong Kong-based online lender that makes loans in China, looks at what apps people have downloaded, where they go using the phones GPS tracker, their social networks and their school records. It offers discounted interest rates for each extra piece of personal information that helps profile customers for credit ratings. In Hong Kong, for example, giving WeLab access to a Facebook account gets a 5 percent discount on the cost of a loan, and access to LinkedIn gets you 10 percent off, on loans with interest rates that otherwise reach as high as 20 percent.\"Chinese people have no issue handing over their personal data, giving you their credit card number, giving you their bank account,\" said GGV Capitals Shanghai-based managing partner Jenny Lee, whose Silicon Valley venture capital firm has invested in data-hungry tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \"Look at the whole internet finance sector, people are giving you their bank statement so you can do profiling.\"Some are perhaps over-sharing. University students desperate for cash have been sending nude photos of themselves as collateral to several online lending platforms, according to the official Peoples Daily. Typically they get loans of 15,000 yuan ($2,280) -- more if theyre doctoral students or enrolled at a famous university, the report said, and at least one loan had a weekly interest rate of 30 percent. Delinquent borrowers face the threat of their naked selfies being sent to family if they dont pay.\n",
      "Uber Rivals $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of Chinas Ride-Sharing Market:The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising. That Didis valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the markets difficulties. In part because of Chinas widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business. In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting Americas biggest tech company against Americas best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth. The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China. Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials.Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given Chinas unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.\n",
      "Good VR is great  and bad VR is abysmal:VR is a powerful medium, but difficult to work with  because the developer is put in the position of creating a sense of self and presence, more is required of them, and while successes are almost impossible to describe properly, failures are conspicuous and easily dissected. Its easiest to illustrate with actual examples. Easily the most interesting VR experience Ive had at E3 (of a dozen or so) was an Oculus demo called The Climb, by a team at Crytek. Using the Touch controllers (a new innovation; previously a gamepad was used), you manipulate a pair of disembodied hands, gripping ridges and cracks to make your way up a cliff face. Like many VR games, it sounds rather boring. In fact, its genius, but only within VR  and like so many other games, the only way to find that out is to play it. Nevertheless, Its excellent for several reasons, and these act as sort of guidelines for content that fits VRs strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Alas, I was disappointed by Final Fantasy XV: The VR Experience, despite being hyped for the game itself. Here, I found, was the worst possible outcome: a game that should and could be interesting, but does almost nothing right.Unlike The Climb, it sounds like a blast on paper. You and the other main characters from the game are in a battle with a Behemoth, one of the games most well-known monsters. Youre Prompto, the one who has a gun, supporting your buddies as they fight hand to hand. What it amounts to, however, and Im heartily sorry to say it, is a disjointed and boring five minutes that may leave you less excited for the game than when you donned the headset.\n"

      "Uber Sets Sights on Leveraged Loans for Even More Money:Uber has raised more than $14 billion using all sorts of creative funding sources. Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market.The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date.Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand.Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued to a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Ubers valuation of $62.5 billion  making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world  would not change with this new investment.Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors  some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.\n",
      "Microsoft, Reasserting Its Muscle, Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion:Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsofts history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.The deal is Microsofts biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition. They know the interconnections of the business world, said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. That could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.\n",
      "Apple Starts to Woo Its App Developers:When Apples App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.Is Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers I think the answer is yes, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. Their app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.For a long time, Apple didnt have to care. But now it faces flat sales of its flagship iPhones, a lack of excitement about newer products like its smart watch and Apple TV, growing competition from Googles Android platform and the rise of new challengers like Amazons Echo device, which responds to a users voice commands at home with the kind of magic that used to be an Apple hallmark.As the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Apples charm offensive began in earnest in December, after it put Philip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in charge of the App Store. Under Mr. Schiller, the company accelerated the app approval process, cutting typical review times from two weeks to a day or two.On Wednesday, Apple announced that it would soon begin allowing app makers to buy ads that would appear at the top of search results in the App Store, like the ads already on Googles Play Store and website.Apple also said that it would cut its usual 30 percent commission on all subscriptions to 15 percent after an app subscriber had been active for at least a year.\n",
      "Thomas J. Perkins, Pioneering Venture Capitalist in Silicon Valley, Dies at 84:Thomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valleys venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84. Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins  and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif.  became a destination for other venture capitalists.Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.The firms success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world. Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the progressive war on the American 1 percent to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language.David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled Mines Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the Worlds Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkinss legacy wont be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed, though he was a seminal figure for Silicon Valley.\n",
      "The app boom is over:The mobile app boom kicked off in July 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store. Now it is over. People are still making plenty of apps, of course. And many people are still downloading them. But the go-go growth days are gone.If you are an independent app developer or publisher, you have probably known this for a while, because you have found it very difficult to get people to download your app  the average American smartphone user downloads zero apps per month.But now even the very biggest app publishers are seeing their growth slow down or stop altogether. Most people have all the apps they want and/or need. They're not looking for new ones.Last month, the top 15 app publishers saw downloads drop an average of 20 percent in the U.S., according to research from Nomura, which relies on data from app tracker SensorTower. So you can still break through the saturated app market, if you are very very very lucky, and good. But the odds are stacked against you.\n",

Soon, as Google demonstrated with the introduction of its voice-activated Google Home device in May, reviews will be read aloud to you as you lie on the couch, wondering what movie to see next.But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results.But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results. In May, Yelp issued 59 new Consumer Alerts, which are notices it puts on a businesss page that it has been caught trying to pay for better reviews. Among those cited were a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and an emergency room in Humble, Tex. Lifehacker.com recently took on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, arguing their way of compiling reviews was fundamentally flawed. FiveThirtyEight.com reported that men are sabotaging the online reviews of TV shows aimed at women. (Why Because they can.)Bart de Langhe, an assistant professor of marketing at Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, used to see numerical reviews online and accept them implicitly. Then, when his son was born three years ago, he needed to buy a car seat. Mr. de Langhe noticed that the seat rated lowest by Consumer Reports got a high rating on Amazon, and the one rated highest by Consumer Reports received a low rating on Amazon.The more popular seat on Amazon was also more expensive. Were reviewers, he wondered, paying more attention to things like price and brand than the objective, measurable ability of the seat to protect its occupant With two other researchers, Philip Fernbach and Donald Lichtenstein, Mr. de Langhe began a study that compared online reviews for items like air-conditioners and car batteries with the evaluations in Consumer Reports.Navigating by the Stars was published in April in The Journal of Consumer Research. After analyzing 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories, the researchers found a substantial disconnect between the objective quality information that online reviews actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them.In other words, the consumer saw a number  4.6 stars out of 5  and took it much more seriously than it merited.Nearly half the time, Amazon reviewers and the Consumer Reports experts disagreed about which item in a random pair was better. Moreover, average user ratings did not predict resale value in the used-product marketplace, another traditional indicator of quality.\n",
      "Uber Rolls Out App Improvements to Meet Driver Demands:Tensions have long simmered between Uber and its drivers who power the ride-hailing service. Drivers held protests when Uber cut fares with little warning and have filed class-action lawsuits to be recognized as company employees rather than independent contractors.Uber is now trying to improve the experience of its drivers.On Monday, the company announced a host of software improvements to its app to address driver demands. Among the changes, drivers can now more easily pause ride requests, making it easier for them to take bathroom breaks and fill their gas tanks. Drivers can now also be paid instantly for each ride they complete, rather than weekly, and see on the apps dashboard how much they have earned.Among the many changes for drivers that Uber announced on Monday was a partnership with companies that can give tax advice to drivers. Uber said drivers could now also receive discounts on Uber rides, auto maintenance and cellphone data plans.In addition, Uber created a fuel finder function in the app that shows drivers the cheapest places nearby to fill up the gas tank, with the aim that Uber can someday negotiate with filling stations to provide discounts to Uber drivers.And the Uber app will automatically start a ride two minutes after arriving at a riders location so that drivers are paid if they have to wait for passengers. Tardy passengers are a frequent complaint on driver blogs.Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg\n"

The money was part of the ride-hailing giants most recent financing round and continued to value the company at $62.5 billion. The investment does not cash out any of Ubers existing investors.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.The investment from Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest single investments collected by the technology worlds top privately held companies. Uber, whose valuation makes it Silicon Valleys most valuable private business, has collected billions at a rapid clip over the last three years.Uber has drawn from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds like that of Qatar have also invested. Other smaller tech companies have not fared as well in raising money over the last several months. Some so-called unicorns, the term used to refer to businesses valued at more than $1 billion, have struggled to collect new investments, and some, like Jawbone, have had to raise money at lower valuations.Uber is racing to defend its territory  which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries  against incumbents in other regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country. Both companies have made no indications that they will back down.Though Uber dominates the American market for ride-hailing, it has increasingly seen overseas markets as crucial to its growth.Among Ubers increasingly important overseas markets is the Middle East, where the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million.

      "Why you should delete the online accounts you dont use anymore  right now:Despite falling out of vogue years ago, MySpace  that old precursor to Facebook  still has details on more user accounts than the United States has people. And now a hefty chunk of those account credentials has been leaked to the entire Internet, in a humbling reminder that the Matchbox Twenty-inspired username you probably made in high school is still worth a heck of a lot to companies and criminals.As many as 360 million MySpace accounts turned up for sale Friday in a 33-gigabyte dump online, according to reports that were confirmed Monday by MySpace's parent, Time Inc.The massive leak includes passwords, email addresses and usernames that were swiped from MySpace in a hack dating back to June 2013, before MySpace made a site redesign that closed some security gaps. It's unclear how many of the accounts in the MySpace hack were still \"active,\" in the sense that they belong to people who continue to log into the service today. But chances are at least some of these accounts hadn't been touched for years. The reason this makes you vulnerable is the same reason experts say you shouldn't use the same username and password for every online service  it makes it easy to take one set of stolen credentials and plug them into others, giving hackers potential access to large swaths of your digital life. Personal data from the MySpace breach was going for sale to the tune of thousands of dollars, highlighting how even outdated information can still carry significant value.

      "The militarys stealth motorcycles are as quiet as an electric toothbrush:The military is funding stealth motorcycles, which would allow riders to quickly sneak up on unsuspecting enemies.The motorcycles operate at 55 decibels  about the level of an electric toothbrush or typical conversation  yet still can reach 80 mph in speed. The extreme quiet is due to the use of electric motors.The motorcycles also feature two-wheel drive to improve traction on gravel, sand or any challenging terrain. The narrow dimensions of the motorcycles allow them to be driven in forests or other places some military vehicles cant go.The electric motors have limited range  the SilentHawk lasts two hours and the other bike, NightMare, has 60 miles of power. So the motorcycles are modified with hybrid engines that can burn almost any type of fuel, such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene or diesel.

Google said it made fair use of that code and owed nothing.The victory for Google cheered other software developers, who operate much the way Google did when it comes to so-called open-source software. Unlike traditional software created by corporations and tightly held, open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify.Great news for progress and innovation, Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, posted on Twitter after the verdict.Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle argued that Google executives violated Oracles copyright by using aspects of Java without permission. The courtroom fight was something of a watershed for technology and could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the worlds biggest data centers.People who work with open-source technology worried that a victory for Oracle would have led other companies to make similar demands of open-source products.It does give a lot of breathing room to other companies and individuals trying to do a lot of innovative activity, said Parker Higgins, director of copyright activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.\n"

      "Alibaba Facing SEC Investigation Over Accounting Practices:Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fell the most in four months after the e-commerce giant said its being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices and whether they violate federal laws.The company is providing documents and cooperating with the probe, according to the Hangzhou, China-based companys annual report. The investigation is looking into consolidation practices, related party transactions and data reported from its Singles Day promotion. Singles Day is Alibabas biggest shopping day, attracting more than 90 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) of sales on its e-commerce platforms in a 24-hour period last year.Alibaba fell 6.8 percent to $75.59, the biggest drop since January. It was down less than 1 percent this year through Tuesday.\n",
      "Toyota and Volkswagen Step Up Investments in Tech Start-Ups:On Tuesday,two of the worlds largest automakers, Toyota and Volkswagen, said they were stepping up to invest in technology start-ups that are working to change the way people travel by car. Toyota said it had formed a partnership with and invested an undisclosed amount in Uber, the biggest ride-hailing company. Gett, the app popular in Europe, said it was working with Volkswagen, and the automaker was investing $300 million in the start-up. The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth. But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services. Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car  or even without knowing how to drive. In January, General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft, the ride-hailing app popular with American users, with a focus on developing networks of autonomous vehicles. Ford Motor is making over its Dearborn, Mich., headquarters into a Silicon Valley-like campus of green buildings connected by self-driving shuttles.And a few weeks ago, Fiat Chrysler and Google agreed to produce a test fleet of driverless minivans. Both BMW and Mercedes-Benz have started to pilot ride services.Even other technology companies only tangentially related to automobiles are becoming more involved in ride services. Apple, which is working on its own autos project, said this month it had invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing company that competes fiercely with Uber.\n",
      "Snapchat is raising more money around $20 billion valuation:Snapchat may have first made its name in the crowded world of mobile apps with an ephemeral messaging service, but the startup and its wildly popular app are not disappearing anywhere soon. TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources that Snapchat is raising yet more financing at around a $20 billion valuation. Sources with knowledge of the deal say the social media giant is in the process of a round of about $200 million. This new financing, we understand, is a follow-on to the $175 million Series F round led by Fidelity. Snapchat was said to be valued at $16 billion in that round, flat on the year before. However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by market analysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Expanding the Series F with a Series FP, as its described in the document below, would also fit in with a description weve heard more than once about Snapchats fundraising: The startup is always raising on a rolling basis, partly because investors are so interested. They get offers all the time, one investor close to the company said. And once you start to grow on this path, many people come to give you money. You dont know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot company and many people are approaching you, you do a market of discovery. That may be different from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchats own fast growth and its taste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.\n",
      "To halt smartphone slide, Samsung rewrites playbook:From the way it chooses smartphone components to the models it brings to market, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has undergone a painful process of breaking from its past to reverse a slide in its handset business. For example, the world's largest smartphone maker agonized over camera specs for its flagship Galaxy S7 until the last moment - ultimately defying industry convention by opting for fewer pixels in exchange for improved autofocus features and low-light performance, a move that contributed to early success. It also pared back its product line-up, overcoming internal resistance, enabling it to streamline production, an executive said. The handset business has now stabilized, and had its best profit in nearly two years in January-March, though historically low smartphone industry growth still leaves Samsung looking for the \"next big thing\". After peaking in 2013, a sharp drop in mobile profits exposed Samsung as slow to adjust to the changing market: its budget devices were overpriced and unappealing versus Chinese offerings, and the 2014 version of its Galaxy S flopped. That prompted a cull among executives and stoked investor worries Samsung might not be able to recover as rivals including Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi gained market share at its expense. There was no sweeping, across-the-board fix. Rather, Samsung embarked two years ago on an overhaul that included a shift from a phone-for-all-needs approach towards a line-up that emphasized economies of scale. It revamped design, using metal frames and curved screens, and gave high-end features such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens to its low- and mid-tier products. The product cull paid off; the revamped models helped Samsung recover in big markets such as India. \"There was a feeling the sheer number of phones in the market was confusing for customers,\" said a Samsung India executive, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with the media.Samsung's Kim says his focus now is on premium-end smartphones - those costing $600 and above - where not all industry players have the muscle to compete.\n",
      "Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up:With this weeks imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the worlds largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a value stock.That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.Mr. Buffett is the worlds most prominent and successful proponent of value investing  an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their intrinsic value, as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic The Intelligent Investor. Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.So value investors took notice when Mr. Buffetts holding company,Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had invested $1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter.Weve just looked at it again, said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. Anybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.Value stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they havent already.Apple is going to attract more value investors, said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. Theyre looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.\n",
      "This $5 Billion Software Company Has No Sales Staff:Atlassian sold $320 million worth of business software last year without a single sales employee. Everyone else in the industry noticed.: Atlassian, which makes popular project-management and chat apps such as Jira and HipChat, doesnt run on sales quotas and end-of-quarter discounts. In fact, its sales team doesnt pitch products to anyone, because Atlassian doesnt have a sales team. Initially an anomaly in the world of business software, the Australian company has become a beacon for other businesses counting on word of mouth to build market share. Customers dont want to call a salesperson if they dont have to, says Scott Farquhar, Atlassians co-chief executive officer. Theyd much rather be able to find the answers on the website. The way technology companies sell software has changed dramatically in the past decade. The availability of open source alternatives has pushed traditional brands and rising challengers to offer more free trials, free basic versions of their software with paid upgrades, and online promotions. Incumbents such as IBM, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which employ thousands of commissioned salespeople, are acquiring open source or cloud companies that sell differently, says Laurie Wurster, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub are among the companies trying to attract corporate clients with small-bore efforts that rely largely on good reviews. The idea is to distribute products to individuals or small groups at potential customers big and small and hope interest spreads upstairs. So far, though, Atlassian remains the most extreme example of this model. Its a 14-year-old company, valued at $5 billion since going public in December, without a single salesperson on the payroll. More than 80 Fortune 100 companies use Atlassians software, and venture capitalists and peers often talk about trying to follow, at least partly, its sales strategy.Atlassians roots lie in Sydneys barren tech scene. It was kept aloft early on not by venture capital, but by the founders credit cards, meaning it didnt have impatient investors to answer to. I dont think their success is replicable, says Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at Redpoint Ventures.\n",
      "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews:Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the countrys Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the countrys military and security agencies. While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.\n"

      "Why a staggering number of Americans have stopped using the Internet the way they used to:Nearly one in two Internet users say privacy and security concerns have now stopped them from doing basic things online  such as posting to social networks, expressing opinions in forums or even buying things from websites, according to a new government survey released Friday.This chilling effect, pulled out of a survey of 41,000 U.S. households who use the Internet, show the insecurity of the Web is beginning to have consequences that stretch beyond the direct fall-out of an individual losing personal data in breach. The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities. The survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey's respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. The NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.\n",
      "Facebook, Facing Bias Claims, Shows How Editors and Algorithms Guide News:Facebook, the largest social media network, published internal editorial guidelines on Thursday, the companys latest attempt to rebut accusations that it is politically biased in the news content it shows on the pages of its 1.6 billion users.The 28-page document details how both editors and computer algorithms play roles in the process of picking what should appear in the Trending Topics section of users Facebook pages.Facebook describes a list of processes it uses to display some of the most popular content across the network, including relying on algorithms to detect up-and-coming news trends as well as a team of editors who, much like a newsroom, direct how those topics are presented and decide what should be displayed to people who regularly use the service.As the guidelines make clear, at practically every point in the process, a human editor is given the leeway to exercise his or her editorial influence.The document was released just days after a report on the tech news siteGizmodo said Facebook editors had intentionally suppressed news topics from conservative publications trending across the network. The report also said editors were able to artificially inflate the importance of other topics by injecting them into the Trending section of users Facebook pages.Since those claims surfaced, Facebook has been questioned by news sites across the political spectrum and by legislators in Washington. On Thursday, critics urged the company to consider the biases of its editors.As long as Facebook is hiring editors who lean left politically, those stories are going to get preferential treatment, Erick Erickson, former editor in chief of the conservative website RedState and founder of another conservative site called The Resurgent, said in an email. Id hope that Facebook would take care to consider all views and all news.The company has continued to deny accusations of political bias and pointed to editorial rules that discourage Trending Topics staff members from taking one viewpoint or another.\n",
      "What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant:To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professors overworked teaching staff.But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watsons true identity to students until after theyd turned in their final exams.Students were amazed. I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class! wrote one in the classs online forum. Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey! said another.Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesnt foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbots question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally dont receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the courses online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the classs previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jills answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as Where can I find assignment two and When is assignment two due Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.There are many questions Jill cant handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isnt human.\n",
      "Amazon and YouTube get ready to rumble over online video:Amazon is moving into the space long held by YouTube, announcing on Tuesday thelaunch of a new platform that allows anyone to post original content.Called \"Amazon Video Direct,\" the site offers creators a way to make money in a variety of ways, including royalties on videos streamed by paying Amazon Prime members, revenue shares for videos rented or purchased, ad impressions for free-to-watch videos, and any combination of these models. The new platform places Amazon in direct competition with Google's YouTube, the firm leader in the video upload space that counts 1 billion users. YouTube has its own revenue sharing model for its top creators. Starting in 2007, it launched its Partners Program, which gave popular content creators a cut of the ad revenue earned from views to their pages.But there has been controversy in connection with the cut that YouTube takes, which is 45% of the revenue, and the site does not offer to cover any video creation costs, leading some YouTube creators to speak out about comparatively unfair profits.Amazon has not yet detailed what percentage of revenue creators will get with the Video Direct service. But it is offering a pay-to-subscribe option direct to each individual channel, similar to Twitch, which allows users to follow specific content creators for a fee. The owner of the channel would make a percentage of the profit from those subscriptions. Amazon will also pay out $1 million as a bonus among the creators of the top 100 videos viewed by Prime members each month.\n",
      "Report claiming bias in Facebook 'trending' topics sparks social media outcry:Facebook workers have often omitted conservative political stories from the websites \"trending\" list, the technology news site Gizmodo said on Monday in a report that sparked widespread comment on social media.An unnamed former Facebook employee told Gizmodo that workers \"routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers,\" according to Gizmodo, while \"artificially\" adding other stories into the trending list.Facebook told Reuters on Monday that there are \"rigorous guidelines in place\" to maintain neutrality and said that these guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in trending topics.Facebook did not respond directly though to questions about whether employees had suppressed conservative-leaning news.\"These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another,\" a spokesperson for Facebook said.The report alarmed some social media users, with several journalists and commentators criticizing Facebook for alleged bias.\"Aside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content,\" tweeted journalist Glenn Greenwald.Well, you go to Hell, Facebook,\" tweeted Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher), a reporter at the Washington Examiner, a conservative-leaning publication.\"For anyone who cares about press freedom, this is frightening stuff,\" tweeted Bloomberg Editor Bill Grueskin (@BGrueskin), with a link to Gizmodo's story.\n",
      "What Do Consumers Want Look at Their Selfies:Allison Shragal, 28, of Chicago, isnt a model, or Internet famous  shes an administrative assistant for a general contracting company. But almost every day companies pay her to snap photos of herself engaging in routine activities  brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, cleaning the bathroom.Her seemingly mundane images, when combined with thousands of others, contain insights that companies like Crest are eager to mine. They are using a Chicago-based company called Pay Your Selfie to gather those insights and present them in reports on consumer behavior that are meant to go where focus groups and surveys cannot.Among the tidbits that Crest, owned by Procter & Gamble, learned from its recent monthlong quest for selfies: Theres a huge spike in brushing from 4 to 6 p.m., probably tied to a desire for happy-hour fresh breath. That knowledge could be useful when Crest decides which times of the day to start future social media campaigns.Users of the app receive anywhere from 20 cents to $1 for each task completed  in Crests case, a snapshot taken while brushing your teeth with your favorite Crest product. Users cant double-dip; the app allows only one selfie per task.The selfies are a good way for companies to obtain information that people cant or dont articulate in focus groups or other traditional research methods, said Ravi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management. For example, they could lead to an understanding of which rituals go along with certain types of consumption, he said.Pay Your Selfie, which has been in business since last September, doesnt require participants to have followers on a site like Instagram. In fact, users dont have to share their images publicly at all (although they can). That makes it different from a company like Popular Pays, which offers Instagrammers the chance to post about brands like Nike in exchange for giveaways or cash.\n",

In 2015, Palantir generated $420 million in revenue, BuzzFeed reported, citing interviews with former and current employees, as well as more than 1,000 internal e-mails and documents. The secretive big data company spent more than $500 million last year, the report said. A spokeswoman didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. Palantirs bookings, which refer to the value of contracts that typically span many years, exceeded $1 billion in 2014 and continued growing in 2015, a person with knowledge of the matter said last year.

American Express Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Nasdaq Inc. were among the companies that walked away from contracts with Palantir over the last year or so, BuzzFeed reported. Hershey Co. is reevaluating its relationship with Palantir, and Kimberly-Clark Corp. considered becoming a customer before deciding that Palantirs high prices were unjustified, the report said.Palantir also counts Axa SA, Bridgewater Associates LP, Credit Suisse Group AG and First Data Corp. among its clients. Its biggest customer is BP Plc, which signed an agreement with Palantir in November 2014 worth $1.2 billion over 10 years, plus bonus payments as determined by executives from both companies, according to BuzzFeed.Employee defections accelerated early this year, and at the current pace, the attrition rate this year would be 20 percent, BuzzFeed reported.

      "Alibaba's revenue soars, but new ventures hit profit:Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, China's biggest e-commerce company, said fourth-quarter sales rose 39 percent after its core online shopping business grew, but profit fell for the first time as it spent on ventures like food delivery.Net income excluding extraordinary items, Alibaba's preferred measure for earnings, shrank 1.4 percent to 7.6 billion yuan from the previous year, as the company continued to invest heavily in new but shakier businesses.Investors welcomed the higher-than-expected revenue, sending the firm's American Depository shares up 3.7 percent. But, not all of Alibaba's businesses looked rosy.Its online finance affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, one of founder Jack Ma's crown jewels in his e-commerce empire, recorded a net loss in the quarter.That business has spent heavily on its intense competition with WeChat Payment, one of the world's largest payments systems and owned by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings.Ant, which houses the massive Alipay online payment platform, is now valued at $60 billion and is gearing up for an IPO, despite the fact it is now losing money. Alibaba did not disclose how much Ant lost. Alibaba's revenues rose to 24.2 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) in the quarter ended March 31 from 17.4 billion yuan a year earlier. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), or the total value of goods transacted on its platforms on China retail marketplaces, rose 24 percent to 742 billion yuan.

      "India rejects Apple's plan to import used iPhones:India has rejected a plan by Apple Inc to import used iPhones, government officials said on Wednesday, a blow to the U.S. tech giant that has been seeking to revive waning sales of its flagship smartphones.Apple sells what it calls refurbished iPhones at a discount in some countries, including the United States. Extending this practice to India would have likely helped it increase its share in one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets against competitors with much cheaper offerings.But India, which is pushing a 'Make in India' initiative to boost the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, rejected the proposal citing rules against importing used electronics.Apple's proposal was opposed by domestic phone makers who claim selling refurbished iPhones - devices that have been returned by buyers or repaired to factory condition after damage - would breach India's anti-dumping rules. The Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association had written to India's telecom ministry to stall the move. The news comes at a time when Apple posted its first-ever drop in iPhone sales amid weakness in China, its most important market after the United States.In India, Apple only has about a 2 percent market share but its sales there surged 56 percent in the first three months, driven mainly by cheaper older-generation devices such as the iPhone 5S while demand for the new iPhone SE disappointed.\"The 5S' success in India has more to do with affordability of a premium brand than a preference for smaller phones, and the move to the more expensive SE will discourage budget buyers,\" said Wilmer Ang, an analyst at research firm Canalys.The newly launched iPhone SE retails at 39,000 rupees ($585) in India - almost $200 higher than its U.S. price.To successfully tap into India's smartphone boom - where sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year - Apple will need a better retail presence and cheaper versions of the iPhone given the average smartphone in the country sells for less than$150, according to analysts.Apple, which currently retails in India through local partners, is already seeking government approval to set up its first store in the country.\n",
      "Uber enables global e-hailing through Alipay to fend against Lyft/Didi alliance:Starting today, Uber riders from China wont have to worry about language barriers or currency when traveling outside of the country.Now, riders will be able to pay for and hail a ride in the Alipay app in the more than 400 cities in which Uber operates. Its an extension of Ubers existing partnership with the company, which initially only allowed passengers in China to pay for their rides using Alipay.The move comes just a few weeks after Lyft and Chinas Didi launched a similar integration that allows Didi riders to hail a Lyft in the U.S. using the Didi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuaidi) app, and vice versa. That partnership is part of a larger global ride-hail alliance that also includes South East Asias Grab and Indias Ola.The clear winner in this entire situation is Alipays affiliate company, Alibaba. Thats because the Chinese e-commerce company is playing both sides of the fence  Alibaba is an investor in both Didi and Lyft, and Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, has had this partnership with Uber since 2014.Its certainly true that Alibaba has a higher stake in Lyft and Didi beating out Uber, but the transportation industry isnt a zero-sum game. Since theres room for both sides to coexist, Alibaba can afford to put bets on Didi and Lyft, and Uber too.But Alipay may be playing favorites. According to company SVP of business Emil Michael, Uber will be the primary featured transportation app on Alipays platform outside of the U.S. Alipay is essentially promoting Uber to its 450 million users.\n",

      "How Foursquare knew before almost anyone how bad things were for Chipotle:Chipotle announced its first loss as a public company Tuesday. But two weeks earlier, an unlikely source the social media app Foursquare  had beat Chipotle to the punch,predicting in a blog post that the burrito makers sales would drop nearly 30 percent. Chipotle made it official Tuesday afternoon  reporting a drop of 29.7 percent. The remarkably accurate prediction from a company consumers know for restaurant tips and the ability to check in at locations highlights the emerging power of the gobs of data our smartphones collect and the opportunity for savvy companies to convert that information into piles of cash. Foursquare has spent seven years collecting data and has 85 million places in its database. It describes its data trove as the biggest foot traffic panel in the world. Clients that buy Foursquares data to glean insights include retailers, real estate developers, Wall Street traders and consumer package-goods companies.Foursquare, the seven-year-old start-up, cleverly turned smartphone data into predictions on Chipotle sales that matched Wall Street analysts with far more experience in projecting the successes of businesses such as Chipotle. Last year, Foursquare used its foot-traffic data to predict how many iPhones Apple would sell on a given weekend. Foursquarepredicted sales of 13 million to 15 million. Apple then announced sales of more than 13 million.Once a handful of Foursquare users have checked in at a location, the company knows that a given location represents a certain store. If the smartphones of another Foursquare user move inside these premises  but doesnt check in  Foursquare still knows the user was in the store. Foursquare relies on GPS data, WiFi, cell towers and beacons to pinpoint where smartphone users are.Data experts caution that there are limits to how far Foursquare can replicate its Chipotle predictions elsewhere. They say Foursquares success will work best at large chains. Foursquare needs a lot of data to make such predictions, so it would probably struggle to accurately predict the sales of a retailer that has only a handful of locations.Another limitation to Foursquares approach is the nature of a store. Chipotle lends itself to a foot-traffic analysis because customers overwhelmingly travel in person to a store to get their food. It would be more difficult to predict the sales at a business that sells a significant amount of goods online.\n",
      "Amazons Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record:Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon reported net income of $513 million, or $1.07 a share, up from a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.Amazons share price jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the results were released. Investors were happy to see the company show profits after the disappointing run of reports from Apple, Google,Microsoft and Intel. The biggest source of the companys profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazons North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazons total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S.  up 64 percent from a year earlier  amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.\n",
      "Facebook revenue smashes expectations as mobile ad sales surge:Facebook Inc's (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago.Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users. \"The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise.Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus.Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier.\n"

      "Apple's nine-year iPhone juggernaut stops with first sales decline since 2003:Apple on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market. The company's sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues. Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple's share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise. After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple's exponential growth. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \"The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\" he said. He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales. Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar. In reaction to Apple's results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Broadcom and NXP Semiconductors all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.\n",
      "The future of TV is arriving faster than anyone predicted: Late last week, Comcast announced a new program that allows makers of smart TVs and other Internet-based video services to have full access to your cable programming without the need for a set-top box. Instead, the content will flow directly to the third-party device as an app, including all the channels and program guide.The Xfinity TV Partner Program will initially be offered on new smart TVs from Samsung, as well as Roku streaming boxes. But the program, built on open Internet-based standards including HTML5, is now open to other device manufacturers to adopt.As video services move from hardware to software, the future of the traditional set-top box looks increasingly grim. With this announcement, Comcast customers may soon eliminate the need for an extra device, potentially saving hundreds of dollars in fees. Many in the industry have long predicted eventual death for the box, driven in part by a rapid migration by pay TV providers (including fiber and satellite-based companies) to Internet standards for both video content and services, and by the enthusiastic response of consumers to a growing number of Internet-based alternatives. These include Roku, as well as Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, SlingTV, Sony, HBO and many others.Consumers, especially younger ones, are interested in defining their own video experience, mixing traditional and self-produced content and enjoying it not just on televisions but on every connected device, including tablets, smartphones and other mobile gadgets.At this years Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it was clear that list would soon grow to include other non-traditional viewing platforms, such as cars, refrigerators and game consoles.Comcasts announcement suggests that future may already be here.\n",
      "A Marriage Gone Bad: Walgreens Struggles to Shake Off Theranos:The sprawling drugstore chain, now a part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, was Theranoss first  and thus far only  direct-to-consumer retail partner, promising to eventually make Theranoss wellness centers an integral part of its more than 8,000 stores nationwide.When it announced the deal in 2013, Walgreens hoped to drive traffic to its stores and bask in the reflected glow from one of Silicon Valleys hottest unicorns and its youthful founder and glamorous chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes.For unproved Theranos, the Walgreens endorsement was akin to the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Theranoss valuation vaulted to $9 billion and put Ms. Holmes on the Forbes list of billionaires.Nearly three years later, with Theranos under siege on multiple regulatory fronts and its reputation in tatters, its clear that the relationship has been a disaster for Walgreens. The company has been trying to distance itself, halting expansion of Theranos testing in its stores and, in January, threatening to end the partnership if Theranos did not meet regulatory standards within 30 days.But that deadline has come and gone. With this weeks news that Theranos is under criminal investigation for, among other things, possibly defrauding Walgreens and other investors, the question is: What will it take for Walgreens to end its troubled relationship Theranoss lawyers have taken a hard line, insisting that Walgreens is contractually bound by their agreement. So far, the approach has worked. Walgreens appears to have taken a cautious approach toward terminating the relationship, perhaps preferring to wait until federal regulators impose penalties or the criminal investigation yields formal charges, either of which would strengthen Walgreenss hand.But that could take years. Theranos can appeal any penalties, and a grand jury investigation could be a protracted process. And Theranos is likely to sue Walgreens in any event if it terminates their agreement.In the meantime, Walgreens risks being dragged into nearly every negative story about Theranos.\n",
      "Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face:For years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apples iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the governments approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The about-face is startling, given Apples record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products  like its mobile payments system Apple Pay  in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company.To a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software  including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad  to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is also reliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales.The company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. Its China numbers will be dissected on Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings.Chinas pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.They are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent, Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China is strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States. Sales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids, investigations and fines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time - so far.\n",
      "Alphabets Earnings Miss Forecasts:European regulators brought the hammer down on Google this week, and investors barely blinked. But when the companys first-quarter numbers came in a little light on Thursday afternoon, its stock immediately plummeted.Both revenue and profit rose sharply from 2015 but missed analysts forecasts. Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.Revenue from what the company calls Other Bets  including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat  was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015. Losses for Other Bets rose to $802 million from $633 million.The number of employees jumped to 64,000 from 55,000 last year. The vast majority of them, the company stressed, were engineers and product managers. A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailers core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge.Google is far behind at No. 3, or perhaps even No. 4 after IBM, said John R. Rymer, an analyst at Forrester Research. Last fall, Google hired Diane Greene, an industry veteran, to run all of its cloud businesses.\n",
      "Facebook considers letting users add a tip jar to make money from posts:Facebook is exploring new ways for individual users to profit from their posts on the network, The Verge has learned. A user survey distributed this week hints at a broad range of ways that users could make money or promote a cause, including a tip jar, branded content and taking a cut of the ad revenue Facebook earns from posts. The survey also asked users to indicate their interest in a call to action button, a way to let followers make donations and a sponsor marketplace to match users with advertisers. Its unclear whether Facebook is considering making these options available to all users; the language of the survey indicated it is targeted at verified users. The survey was spotted on the page of a verified user with a relatively small following. (Okay, it was me.)Facebook does not currently offer individual users a way to earn money by posting on Facebook. It has allowed publishers to sell advertising inside its fast-loading Instant Articles format, and recently clarified rules allowing posts sponsored by brands to be shared by verified pages. Facebook is also testing ads within the suggestions that pop up after you watch a video, sharing money with publishers. But recently, the company has taken steps to make its publishing tools more widely available. In February, the company began letting anyone publish Instant Articles.\n",
      "Intel to Cut 12,000 Jobs as PC Demand Slumps:Intel, the worlds largest maker of semiconductors, said on Tuesday that it was laying off 12,000 people, about 11 percent of its work force, as it continues to reel from a long downturn in global demand for personal computers. Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits.Intel's shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year. Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The companys other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10,500 employees.\n"

      "Netflixs Forecast for Growth Disappoints Wall Street:On Monday, Netflix announced that it expected to add just two million members outside the United States in the second quarter this year  less than the 3.5 million analysts had expected. The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding its international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content. That uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States. Netflix had forecast that it would reach nearly 80.9 million total paid members in the quarter.In the United States, Netflix surpassed its forecasts for subscriber growth during a period in which price increases went into effect for some customers. The company added 2.23 million subscribers in America during the quarter, bringing its paid membership in the country to 45.7 million.Outside the United States, Netflix also beat its expectations for growth, adding 4.5 million international streaming subscribers.The company said it was planning to spend more than $6 billion on programming in 2017, up from $5 billion this year.\n",
      "Facebooks ambitious plan to make you a VR convert:Alongside announcements about drones, bots and other plans to use its Messenger app to take over the world, Facebook also spent quite a bit of time talking about virtual reality. The company, of course, is the owner of Oculus  the VR firm with the most general recognition  and just released its first commercial VR headset, the Rift. The Rift is focused on gaming right now, but Facebook has been saying since it bought Oculus in 2014 that it has broader plans for making Oculus's technology work for more general social interaction. Sheikh laid out a world where users could play a poker game with friends over VR that is so sensitive that you can read their tells. He describes what it could mean to people who live far away from their families to be able to interact with them through a headset. And he said that eventually his team hopes to make VR social interaction \"indistinguishable from real life.\" Of course, this will all take a lot of work. Right now, the commercial Rift doesn't even represent your hands in VR, though that is poised to changebefore the year is out. But Sheikh also described research that would let users put their whole bodies in a virtual world and accurately map facial expressions. The team is also trying to analyze real-world social interactions, to figure out how to let virtual interactions flow as seamlessly as in-person meetings.He also warned that all the visions he laid out in his portion of the keynote speech were far from ready for prime-time. A study released Wednesday by Greenlight VR predicted that it will take six to eight years for virtual reality to go fully mainstream. Given all the research that Sheikh said had to be completed to make social presence really work during the Facebook keynote, that sort of timeline could actually seem a little ambitious.\n",
      "Lyft Is Gaining on Uber as It Spends Big for Growth:In January, Lyft said it raised $1 billion, which is helping fuel the spending spree and steal market share from Uber Technologies Inc. To keep costs in check, Lyft has promised investors to cap its losses at no more than $50 million a month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Meanwhile, Uber has been working to fulfill its own promise to shareholders and employees that it would achieve profitability in North America by the second quarter of 2016, a milestone it says it has now reached in the U.S. and Canada. In February, Uber earned an average of 19 per ride in the U.S., according to previously undisclosed financial documents. Uber takes about a 25 percent cut of a typical fare, most of which goes to antifraud efforts, credit-card processing, customer support, marketing, and software development, the documents show. Not included in Ubers profitability calculations are interest, taxes, or equity-based compensation for employees.Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanicks commitment to profitability has left an opening for Lyft, and the smaller upstarts free-spending strategy is starting to pay off. Lyft says it has captured 45 percent of trips in Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles and 43 percent in San Francisco, where both companies are based. Uber says it had 55 percent of ride-hailing sales in Austin, 75 percent in Los Angeles, and 66 percent in San Francisco, citing third-party credit card data from the first two weeks of March. Uber says Lyft has shaken loose only a few percentage points. From everything Im looking at, were gaining share in all top 20 markets, which is where 80 percent to 90 percent of rides happen, says Lyft President John Zimmer. This continues to prove what we said all along, which is once you hit a certain level of scale, its a natural duopoly.Outside of big cities, though, its still Uber country. Of 169 million trips booked through Uber worldwide in March, the company says 50 million of those were in the U.S. Lyft says it did 11 million U.S. rides that month, up from 7 million in October.Lyft continues to devise newand often expensiveways to expand in the U.S., the only country in which it operates. When a Lyft driver refers someone to sign up as a new driver, both get a $750 bonus in some cities. And Lyft has the capacity to keep spending. Zimmer says the company still has by far the majority of the $2 billion its raised from investors. This allows us to control our own destiny. We do not need to raise any additional capital, and its just a fantastic position to be in.Whether Lyfts gains will stick remains to be seen. Uber says customers lured away by subsidies are the most likely to return if Lyfts prices go up. Its easy enough to buy trips with heavy subsidies for drivers and discounts for riders, Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, wrote in an e-mail. But to build a successful, long-term business, you need a path to profitabilitywhich Uber has always had.\n",

      "Facebook Bets on a Bot Resurgence, Chattier Than Ever:On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company  from Applebees to Zara  could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.Were conversational creatures, David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. Thats the way our brain functions. Thats the way were wired. As a result, its probably the most natural interface there is.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the companys future over the next five, 10 and 15 years. Under his plan, people would accompany Facebook as it builds out a comprehensive global system of communications, virtual reality and shopping.We all have a desire to be understood and relate to each other, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Were always trying to get closer to capturing the purest form.Facebooks push into chatbots, which is part of that vision, follows other recent signs of bot life. Late last month, Microsoft released a bot called Tay that was designed to have discussions with people on Twitter  only to curtail the effort when people taught the software to repeat racist and other offensive remarks. Still, Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella,trumpeted bots days later at a developer conference, saying the software could be used to produce new methods of interaction.\n",
      "Apple Watch verdict a year later: Half of those surveyed think its a dud:More than half of those surveyed by the advertising technology company Fluent said they considered the Apple Watch a flop.That sentiment  expressed by the majority of the 2,578 adults in the U.S. who responded last week to an online survey  reflects how the device is perceived by the tech press and industry insiders, many of whom have been pessimistic about the Apple Watch from the start. Asked whether they considered the Watch a successful product for Apple, 53 percent responded no.But Fluents survey also offers a more nuanced picture of Apples first wearable device,which launched on April 24, 2015. A significant majority of Apple Watch owners  77 percent  consider the smartwatch a success and about two-thirds said they plan to upgrade when the next version comes out.Those owners surveyed said they take advantage of a range of the smartwatchs features, including monitoring their activity and receiving notifications (79 percent), listening to music (75 percent) and checking email or chat (66 percent). This survey supports the more comprehensive findings of Wristlys Pulse on Wristware, released earlier this year. The research group, which surveys some 2,500 smartwatch and fitness band owners every week, says that despite some views of the Apple Watch as a mediocre novelty, it enjoys astoundingly high customer satisfaction ratings.\n",
      "Elon Musks SpaceX nails landing at sea:After several unsuccessful attempts to land an unmanned rocket on a football field-sized floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, Elon Musks SpaceX finally pulled off the dramatic feat Friday afternoon in its first launch to resupply the International Space Station since its rocket exploded last year.The landing, the first ever of a rockets first stage at sea, was heralded as a breakthrough for the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry, and its leader, SpaceX. The companies efforts to recover their rockets is part of what Bezos calls the Holy Grail quest of lowering the cost of space flight, which has been so prohibitively expensive that it has long been the exclusive domain of governments.Typically, the first stages of rockets are ditched into the ocean after firing their engines for a few minutes and boosting a second stage, or a capsule, to space.But if the commercial sector can build innovative rockets that can be reused, many think that would dramatically reduce the costs, a key step toward making space travel more routine.SpaceX broadcast the launch and landing live on its website, where some 80,000 viewers watched the booster descend toward the platform. The first stage was hurtling toward space when it started a bit of aerial acrobatics, turning itself around and heading back toward Earth.As it approached the platform, the booster was tilted into the wind but was able to right itself just before touching down, about nine minutes after liftoff. Crews were expected to board the ship and secure the rocket to the platform.\n"

      "Amazon May Violate Indias New Rules on Foreign E-Commerce:For Amazon, no country is more important to its global growth ambitions than India, the second-most-populous nation in the world behind China, where online shopping is in its infancy and growing explosively.But Amazons India plans just ran into a hitch.Late last month, the Indian government issued additional rules governing foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country. The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.Last week, Indian regulators confirmed that online marketplaces, which had operated in a gray era, are legal. But they added a rule saying that no single seller can account for more than 25 percent of sales on such an e-commerce marketplace. It also limited the influence that online marketplaces can exert over the prices set by their sellers.The new regulations appear to make Amazons dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the sites sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. Indias leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem.\n",

The unit clocked $7.9 billion in revenue in 2015, amounting to more than 7 percent of Amazons overall sales, with an operating margin of 24 percent.Many characterized AWS as a bold  and unusual  bet when we started, Bezos wrote. We could have stuck to the knitting. Im glad we didnt.\n",
      "WhatsApp completes end-to-end encryption rollout:Its a security project thats taken around a year and a half to complete, but messaging giant WhatsApp has now fully implemented strong end-to-end encryption on its platform and across all mobile platforms for which it offers apps.This means users of the latest versions of the messaging app will have their comms and media end-to-end encrypted by default. And there are a lot of WhatsApp users; earlier this year the Facebook owned company announced it had passed a billion active users.Securing cross-platform video comms was the last piece of the puzzle, according to a WhatsApp spokesman.End-to-end encryption means the content of communications are not stored in plaintext on WhatsApps servers. Nor is the company able to decrypt users messages to access them since it does not hold the encryption keys. So WhatsApp will be unable to be compelled to hand over messaging data  even if served with a warrant by authorities demanding access.\n",

      "Tesla says Model 3 orders top $10 billion in first 36 hours:Tesla Motors said orders for its new Model 3 electric sedan topped 253,000 in the first 36 hours -- a fast start for the company's first mass-market vehicle, which may not begin to reach customers for another 18 months or more.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the Model 3, which is slated to go into production in late 2017, will sell at an average price of $42,000, including the price of options and additional features, which would give the initial flurry of orders an estimated retail value of $10.6 billion.That intense interest, fanned in part by a steady stream of tweets by Musk, could help boost Tesla's stock price, which closed Friday at $237.59, up 3.4 percent. The stock has soared more than 60 percent since hitting a 12-month low in February.The car's average selling price projected by Musk is well above the $35,000 base price. Analysts earlier had estimated the first Model 3s off the factory line in Fremont, California, could be loaded with extra equipment and sell for $50,000 to$60,000.Tesla has undertaken a costly expansion of the Fremont plant, aiming to boost annual capacity to 500,000 by 2020, with production of the Model 3, the company's first mass-market car, ramping up slowly through 2019.Some analysts said the company could have trouble filling all the initial Model 3 orders, which are accompanied by a refundable $1,000 deposit, until 2020.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson on Friday said the heavy influx of Model 3 orders \"sets the stage for an equity offering\" later this year by Tesla, much of which would go toward factory construction and product development.\n",
      "Where's the lane Self-driving cars confused by shabby U.S. roadways, Volvo CEO is not amused:Volvo's North American CEO, Lex Kerssemakers, lost his cool as the automaker's semi-autonomous prototype sporadically refused to drive itself during a press event at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"It can't find the lane markings!\" Kerssemakers griped to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who was at the wheel. \"You need to paint the bloody roads here!\" Shoddy infrastructure has become a roadblock to the development of self-driving cars, vexing engineers and adding time and cost. Poor markings and uneven signage on the 3 million miles of paved roads in the United States are forcing automakers to develop more sophisticated sensors and maps to compensate, industry executives say. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the mundane issue of faded lane markings \"crazy,\" complaining they confused his semi-autonomous cars. In other developed countries, greater standardization of road signs and markings makes it easier for robot cars to navigate. In the U.S., however, traffic lights can be aligned vertically, horizontally or \"dog-house\" style in two columns. Pavement markings use paint with different degrees of reflectivity - or don't exist at all.\"If the lane fades, all hell breaks loose,\" said Christoph Mertz, a research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. \"But cars have to handle these weird circumstances and have three different ways of doing things in case one fails.\" To make up for roadway aberrations, carmakers and their suppliers are incorporating multiple sensors, maps and data into their cars, all of which adds cost.Mercedes says the \"drive pilot\" system found in its recently unveiled luxury E Class 2017 sedans works even with no lane markings. The system - which incorporates 23 sensors - takes into account guard rails, barriers, and other cars to keep cars in their lanes up to 84 miles (135km) per hour, under \"suitable circumstances.\"Boston Consulting Group estimates that initial semi-autonomous features add $4,000 to a car's price.\n",
      "With $340 million in revenue, Nest is underperforming, and its future at Google is at risk:Nest generated about $340 million in sales last year, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Thats an impressive figure for a company in the very nascent market of Internet-connected devices. Nest currently sells three products: The flagship smart thermostat; Protect, its smoke detector; and Nest Cam, the home-monitoring video predecessor to Dropcam.But its below the initial expectations Google had set for Nest when it bought the startup in 2014 for a whopping $3.2 billion. The companys sales performance may face even deeper scrutiny inside Googles new parent company, Alphabet, where Nest now sits, as the hardware maker faces its most critical year ever. Alphabet, whose execs have spoken regularly about controlling costs at the non-Google companies, may become less charitable. And in the meanwhile,Nest's CEO got slammed in a column in TechCrunchfor the culture there:though the company currently manufactures three products  its thermostat, a smoke alarm, and its Nest cam (via its Dropcam acquisition)  it has repeatedly delayed product releases and disappointed its customers, particularly given the billing that Nests products receive.In one of the more visible cases of customer dissatisfaction, a New York Times reporter said in January that a software bug drained his Nest thermostats battery, a discovery he made only when his infant began crying from his chilly bedroom in the middle of the night. Nests smart smoke alarm has also been plagued by software glitches.In the meantime, says The Information, Google has moved forward on similar efforts, including its OnHub wireless router and a stealth project to create a competitor to Amazons Echo.That Google has done so without Nests involvement must be demoralizing to Nests current employees, who were presumably drawn to the challenge of helping Nest become one of the worlds great hardware companies.But theres reason for even more concern going forward: Fadell has created a culture thats increasingly unlikely to attract the worlds best engineers, which has always been the top priority for its parent company. (Google, in stark contrast, is consistently ranked as one of thebest places to work.)If Alphabet wants to maintain its feel-good reputation, it may be time to part ways with Fadell, or at least to demote him. Hes now had more than two years to prove himself.What Fadell has shown instead is that hes unable to get out of his own way  or Nests.\n"

      "Beijing Seeks to Tighten Reins on Websites in China:Chinas government said on Monday that it would take steps to more strictly manage websites in the country, its latest push to set boundaries in the wider Internet.A draft law posted by one of Chinas technology regulators said that websites in the country would have to register domain names with local service providers and with the authorities.It was not clear whether the rule would apply to all websites or only to those hosted on servers in China. Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply.If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country.If the law applies only to sites hosted in China, it would still represent a consolidation of power by Beijing. Forcing registration with Chinese entities is likely to create a new boom in domain-name service registrars. At the moment, Alibaba operates Chinas primary domain-name service provider, called Wan Wang.The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said. The new rules are the latest in a string of measures taken by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping to assert control over the Internet. This year, regulators created rules to block foreign companies from publishing online content in China without the governments consent. Regulators also shut down the social media accounts of the sharp-tongued tycoon Ren Zhiqiang.\n",
      "U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple:The Justice Department said on Monday that it had found a way to unlock an iPhone without help from Apple, allowing the agency to withdraw its legal effort to compel the tech company to assist in a mass-shooting investigation.The decision to drop the case  which involved demanding Apples help to open an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in the Decembershooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people  ends a legal standoff between the government and the worlds most valuable public company. The case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the authorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important.Yet law enforcements ability to now unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method. A second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apples iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.\n",
      "In Yahoo, Another Example of the Buyback Mirage: It is one of the great investment conundrums of our time:Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that its buying back sharesStated simply, repurchase programs can be hazardous to a companys long-term financial health and often signal a management that has run out of better ways to invest in the business.And yet investors love them. Not all stock repurchases are bad, of course. But given the enormous popularity of buybacks nowadays, those that are harmful probably outnumber the beneficial.Those who run companies like buybacks because they make their earnings look better on a per-share basis. When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.But a companys overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.Consider Yahoo. The company bought back shares worth $6.6 billion from 2008 to 2014, according to Robert L. Colby, a retired investment professional and developer of Corequity, an equity valuation service used by institutional investors. These purchases helped increase Yahoos earnings per share about 16 percent annually, on average.But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoos overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.Yahoo is not alone. Mr. Colby conducted a cost-benefit analysis of 26 companies buying back stock versus using that money to invest in a business.He found that McDonalds was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonalds has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period. To equal that growth in overall earnings, the company would have had to generate just a 2.3 percent return on the money it spent buying back stock, Mr. Colby estimated.Last November, Moodys Investors Service downgraded McDonalds unsecured debt rating, citing its plans to increase its borrowings in part to fund future buybacks.\n",
      "The Uber Model, It Turns Out, Doesnt Translate:Other than Uber, the hypersuccessful granddaddy of on-demand apps, many of these companies have come under stress. Across a variety of on-demand apps, prices are rising, service is declining, business models are shifting, and in some cases, companies are closing down. Here is what we are witnessing: the end of the on-demand dream. That dream was about price and convenience. Many of these companies marketed themselves as clever hacks of the existing order. They werent just less headache than old-world services, but because they were using phones to eliminate inefficiencies, they argued that they could be cheaper, too  so cheap that as they grew, they could offer luxury-level service at mass-market prices. So do a lot of other apps offering services across a number of industries. They are super convenient, but the convenience comes at a premium, which seems here to stay. Some of these services could make for fine businesses, but it is hard to call them groundbreaking. After all, paying extra for convenience isnt really innovative  it is pretty much how the world has always worked. Before we get to why many on-demand apps have struggled to achieve mass-market prices, it is important to remember why anyone ever thought they could: because Uber did it. The ride-hailing company that is valued by investors at more than $60 billion began as a luxury service. The magic of Uber was that it used its growth to keep cutting its prices and expand its service. Uber shifted from a convenient alternative to luxury cars to an alternative to taxis to, now, a credible alternative to owning a car. But Ubers success was in many ways unique. For one thing, it was attacking a vulnerable market. In many cities, the taxi business was a customer-unfriendly protectionist racket that artificially inflated prices and cared little about customer service. The opportunity for Uber to become a regular part of peoples lives was huge. Many people take cars every day, so hook them once and you have repeat customers. Finally, cars are the second-most-expensive things people buy, and the most frequent thing we do with them is park. That monumental inefficiency left Uber ample room to extract a profit even after undercutting what we now pay for cars.But how many other markets are there like that Not many. Some services were used frequently by consumers, but werent that valuable  things related to food, for instance, offered low margins. Other businesses funded in low-frequency and low-value areas were a trap, Mr. Walk said.\n",
      "Uber-Ola battle goes from the streets to court:Uber alleges Ola employees are making bookings on its platform by creating fake accounts, seeks Rs50 crore in damages; Ola denies the charges. Uber alleged that Ola is intentionally causing it to lose sales. Uber alleged in court that Olas employees are making bookings on Ubers platform by creating fake accounts and then cancelling them. This is the equivalent of a shopping sites employee placing orders on a rival site and then returning the goods for no good reason. Uber calculated the total loss incurred by it because of such alleged practices by Ola and sought damages worthRs.496,164,780 from the latter. A total of 93,859 fake accounts have been created by Ola, which have been used to make 4,05,649 false bookings across various cities that were later cancelled, it said. Such cancellations roughly amounted to 8-10% of its total bookings, Uber added. Uber and Ola are fighting for dominance of Indias cab business that, according to Olas largest investor SoftBank Group, may be worth $7 billion by 2020. Justice Vipin Sanghi, who was hearing the matter, issued notices to both ANI Technologies Ltd (Ola) and Serendipity Infolabs (TaxiForSure, acquired by Ola) asking for replies to be filed before the next date. Olas statement denying all allegations was also recorded. A day after Alexanders interview was published, a senior Ola official said the companys newly launched low-cost offering, Micro, will soon do more daily cab rides than all of Uber India.According to US-based Uber, the company has wiped out Olas massive lead in a year. In January last year, we were at 5% market share. Now we are right at the edge of 50%. I would say that within the next 30 days we would beat them (Ola). We will surpass them very, very shortly, Alexander had said in an interview on 16 March.\n",

      "Google Puts Boston Dynamics Up for Sale in Robotics Retreat:Executives at Google parent Alphabet Inc., absorbed with making sure all the various companies under its corporate umbrella have plans to generate real revenue, concluded that Boston Dynamics isnt likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years and have put the unit up for sale, according to two people familiar with the companys plans.Possible acquirers include the Toyota Research Institute, a division of Toyota Motor Corp., and Amazon.com Inc., which makes robots for its fulfillment centers, according to one person. Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didnt respond to requests for comment. Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.At the heart of Replicants trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Googles other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the units failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, we as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,\" and that \"theres some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.\"\n",
      "Flipkart and Amazon may have explored sale talks, say sources:Flipkart reportedly considered selling itself to Amazon, upending the notion that Indias largest online retailer would go full distance as an independent Internet giant. half-a-dozen sources told ET of the discussions between Flipkart and Amazon, and emphasised there is no reason to believe that a deal will be struck or that talks are still ongoing between the two.The talks were held until as recently as the last quarter of 2015, one of the sources said. ET was not able to determine the exact timeline of these talks or if they were initiated by one of Flipkart's investors.Flipkart itself denied that it is up for sale, or that it is in the market for capital. Three of the sources, who are top-level executives in venture capital and private equity firms, said Amazon made a preliminary offer of up to $8 billion to acquire Flipkart, nearly half of its previous stated valuation of $15.2 billion. A mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley slashed the value of its Flipkart shares by 27% last month to about $11 billion, increasing speculation that new investors will back the company at a lower valuation. Flipkart-Amazon talks went cold after the offer was perceived to be too low, but the sources said the situation can change given Alibaba's interest in Flipkart.\n",
      "Sony PlayStation VR to launch globally in October, cost $399:Sony Corp announced on Tuesday that its virtual reality headset for PlayStation will launch globally in October for $399, a move that undercuts its biggest competitor by hundreds of dollars.Andrew House, head of Sony's gaming division, made the announcement during a press event at the Video Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where virtual reality gaming counterpart Oculus Rift announced its headset a day earlier.The headset, a visor-style frame with a 5.7 inch (14.5 centimeters) screen, includes 360 degree head tracking, a 100 degree field of vision and latency of 18 milliseconds between the time a user's head moves and the time they see the correct image. At $399,the package is notably less than the $599 price announced Monday by Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus Rift. Oculus will also sell bundles that include an Oculus Ready PC and a Rift for preorder in February starting at $1,499. The company said more than 230 developers are building content for the PlayStation VR device and 50 games are expected to be ready by the launch date.

      "Wall Street Tours the Tesla Factoryand Loves What It Sees:Wall Street analysts have been touring Teslas massive factory in Fremont, Calif., and they're returning with the same conclusion: Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company is getting ready for something big. In a sign of this enthusiasm, Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded its Tesla rating on Monday morning following a factory tour. Last week, Stifel analysts returned from their fourth visit in four years to Teslas flagship factory in Fremont. In roughly one year since our last visit, wrote analyst James Albertine, the progress witnessed is truly stunning.\" Tesla shares have jumped 45 percent in the past month as Musk, the chief executive, sought to reassure investors that the company is still on track after the challenging and much-delayed launch of the Model X luxury SUV. Stifel and Credit Suisse both noted Tesla's new aluminum stamping press, which Credit Suisse's Galves says has 10 to 20 times the output of Tesla's older machine. The bodies of the Model S and Model X are both made of aluminum, which costs twice as much as steel but weighs less. Tesla hasn't yet disclosed the composition of the Model 3. Keeping the weight down on electric vehicles helps achieve the maximum range on the battery, but maintaining a balance between cost and performance is crucial for a mass-market plug-in car.Tesla has built a new state-of-the-art paint shop that's capable of scaling up to 500,000 cars a year. That happens to be Tesla's production forecast for 2020, a 10-fold increase from last year's sales. If Tesla is to achieve that lofty goal, paint jobs won't be a holdup.\n",

A group of researchers at the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University has been exploring the limits of friction in the design of tiny robots that have the ability to pull thousands of times their weight, wander like gecko lizards on vertical surfaces or mimic bats.Now they have pushed biomimicry in a new direction. They have taken their inspiration from tiny ants that work as teams to move massive objects. In this case, they are not just taking ideas from nature  the movie Big Hero 6 made a great deal of what swarms of microrobots could do, including tossing cars.The researchers approach is counterintuitive. Rather than striking powerful blows like a football player making a tackle or a jackhammer, they have focused on synchronizing the smooth application of very tiny forces. The microrobots work in concert, if slowly.The researchers observed that the ants get great cooperative force by each using three of their six legs simultaneously. Their new demonstration is the functional equivalent of a team of six humans moving a weight equivalent to that of an Eiffel Tower and three Statues of Liberty, Mr. Christensen said. The car is the one he uses for commuting to campus. Part of the magic is the use of a special adhesive that was inspired by gecko toes.\n",

TechCrunch has learned from sources that Flipkart is looking to raise up to $1 billion in funding to grow its business and shore up against competition from local rival Snapdeal and global giant Amazon.

      "The Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise:Many of the worlds largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget. At the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isnt made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon  a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop. What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isnt much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks  playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list  that you can already do on your phone. But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too. In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google  the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world  with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes. First, its simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitivethan those of many other vocal assistants (like Apples Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers. More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial  there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command  to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities. Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexas brain into their own devices, so soon you wont need an Echo to consult with Alexa  you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.\n"

      "Apple Ransomware Attack Casts Light on a Booming Shadow Industry:The first widespread ransomware attack on Apple Inc. computers is drawing attention to a growing and lucrative corner of the hacking underworld where attackers encrypt and hold data hostage until they are paid to unlock the information.An estimated 6,500 Macs were infected with malicious software designed to make files inaccessible to owners of desktops and laptops, according to the Transmission Project, a file-sharing software provider. The decision to target Apples OS X software, which is both harder to hack and less widespread than Microsoft Corp.s Windows, underscores how attractive the practice has become, according to Clifford Neuman, who teaches cybersecurity at the University of Southern California. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks Inc. discovered the ransomware, which they dubbed KeRanger, on March 4. Once downloaded and installed, the bug demanded that users pay one bitcoin to decrypt the data, or about $411 at Fridays prices. The researchers informed Apple, which revoked a certificate that allowed Macs to download the software, and Transmission updated its program to eliminate the infection, according to Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks. The business model is working so well on Windows that, when they had an opportunity to do so on Mac, they did it, Olson said. Its been effective to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\n",
      "Snapchat Thinks It Will Generate at Least $300 Million in Revenue This Year: Investors are buying into Snapchats massive $16 billion valuation because its business is growing significantly. Or at least expected to grow significantly in 2016. Snapchat is targeting between $300 million and $350 million in revenue in 2016, according to multiple sources familiar with the companys plans. Thats six or seven times the $50 million in revenue Snapchat projected last year. Snapchats business is still new and evolving, and advertiser interest is still very experimental. Essentially that means it can be tough to predict incoming revenue with much accuracy, as most advertisers dont have Snapchat as a staple of their advertising plans. The company hit a $100 million revenue run rate in Q4, according to one source. Advertising is cyclical, and Q4 is usually a strong advertising quarter, but its worth noting because the run rate metric gives us a glimpse at how the business is growing. Still, boosting projected revenue like that must mean the businesses is growing at a nice clip. We dont know if the $16 billion valuation is pegged to this years expected revenue, but if it were, that would amount to more than 50 times this years sales. Facebook, by comparison, trades at a value of about 17 times its annual revenue.\n",

Rather than requiring an electrical wall connection, the Tap runs off a rechargeable battery. It connects with phones and the Internet through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.The Tap acts as an ordinary wireless speaker for a phone, but it also provides Alexa on the go. People can ask about weather and traffic, ask for the news, tell it to play a song from a streaming service, or do any one of dozens of other tasks. The device, which will begin shipping at the end of the month, will sell for about $130. Amazon also announced the Echo Dot, essentially an Echo without that devices powerful speaker. The Dot, which will sell for about $90, looks like a hockey puck, and is meant to provide Alexas voice functions for existing speaker systems. The Dot connects to those speakers either through a wire or over Bluetooth; after that, it functions as another Echo.Dot shipments also willbegin at the end of March. Sales will initially be limited to people who already own an Echo or one of Amazons Fire TV devices  a Dot buyer will have to ask Alexa to order one.The new devices suggest that Amazon has an expansive vision for the Echo, which looked like an experiment for the company when it was introduced in late 2014. The company has not provided sales data for the device, but it has said that sales exceeded its expectations and that customer reviews are rhapsodic.Amazon appears to have increased investment in the device  it keeps adding new features and capabilities to Alexa, and this year it ran Super Bowl ads about the gadget.\n",
      "With Bet on Japan, Sharp Stumbles:When flat-screen televisions began replacing boxy analog sets in the worlds living rooms more than a decade ago, few companies bet bigger on the new technology than Sharp of Japan.The century-old manufacturer, which got its start making belt buckles andmechanical pencils before World War I, defied corporate orthodoxy by building an advanced new display factory in its homeland, while rivals outsourced to cheaper countries.The gamble paid off  for a while. Made-in-Japan Kameyama model TVs, named for the factory, became a hit, and Sharp reaped big profits.We were winners then, said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp.Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt. Sharps plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japans in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industrys center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States.Sharps leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the companys financial distress.As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan.Sharp had found a rescuer in a Taiwanese company called Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple and others and was offering a $5.5 billion lifeline. But Sharp unexpectedly told its would-be rescuer last week that it could be liable for close to $3 billion in potential costs, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Foxconn is still examining the sudden disclosure, and it isnt clear whether the Taiwanese company will complete the deal.\n",
      "Fidelity Writes Down Value of Corporate Software Startups:Fidelity Investments slashed the value of its holdings in several corporate software startups in January, while taking a more optimistic view of private consumer-technology companies such as Snapchat and Uber.The value of Dropbox Inc. shares were marked down 10 percent in January from the price in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from public filings. Fidelity also wrote down its stake in the cloud storage company last year. The fund manager periodically readjusts the value of its private stock holdings, based on a variety of factors, and is required to disclose the new values publicly.CloudFlare Inc., maker of Web performance and cybersecurity software for businesses, took a much bigger hit. Fidelity marked down its holdings in that company by 31 percent. CloudFlare Chief Executive Officer Matthew Prince blamed the writedown on market conditions and said Fidelity had marked up the company's value twice before. \"When the market recovers, we'll recover with it,\" he said. Although Prince wasn't happy about the decrease, he saw it as a \"baby step\" toward becoming a public company, when a company's stock price fluctuates constantly.DocuSign Inc., which makes electronic signature technology for contracts and other documents, and Nutanix Inc., a maker of software and hardware for data centers that filed to go public in December, were each written down by 17 percent. Fidelity also marked down Twilio Inc., which makes tools for app developers, by 13 percent.Consumer apps fared better in January. Fidelity did not change its valuations for Airbnb Inc., Pinterest Inc., Snapchat, and Uber, despite a rough month in the public markets and signs of a slowdown in private investments. About a quarter of mature startups raised money at lower valuations in the fourth quarter than in previous rounds, according to a study by Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West LLP. More than half of those later-stage deals included terms that guarantee new investors get their money back before other shareholders.Fidelity's markdowns of corporate software startups came after a brutal month for their publicly traded peers. IBM and VMware Inc. reported disappointing earnings forecasts in January. Many technology companies said they expected a tough IT climate for 2016 and often cited a deteriorating macroeconomic environment as a factor.The Standard and Poor's 500 Index was down 5.1 percent in January, but several enterprise software companies were well below that. Box Inc., a Dropbox rival, plunged 23 percent. Workday Inc. fell 21 percent. Salesforce.com Inc. dropped 13 percent.Despite the dismal climate, Fidelity didn't write down every enterprise startup. For example, the fund manager kept the value of its shares in Cloudera Inc., a Silicon Valley Big Data company, unchanged in January.\n",
      "Souq, Online Retailer in Middle East, Gets a $275 Million Boost:Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere. Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country. Souqs latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank. Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group  which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009  still holds a majority stake. Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.\n",
      "Morgan Stanley fund marks down Flipkart stake value by 27%:A mutual fund investor in Flipkart Ltd, Indias largest e-commerce firm, has slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%, the latest indication that the investor rush of the past two years into Indian startups has led to unsustainable valuations.Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust valued its stake in Flipkart at $58.9 million as of 31 December, down from $80.6 million in June 2015. The company reported the number late Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US stock markets regulator. Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust also cut the value of its stake in other high flying startups including file storage company Dropbox Inc. and data analytics company Palantir.Flipkart was valued at $15 billion when it received $700 million from Tiger Global Management, Qatar Investment Authority and other investors in June. That was its fourth round of fund raising in a year. Its valuation shot up roughly 5 times from $2.5-3 billion in May 2014. Morgan Stanleys latest estimate implies that the mutual fund currently values Flipkart at $11 billion. Mint reported on 4 February that Chinas Alibaba Group is in early talks to buy a stake in Flipkart and increase its holding in Flipkart rival, Snapdeal. The talks are at a very initial stage and the likelihood of a deal is a function of Flipkarts willingness to offer a discount on its current valuation of $15 billion, Mint had reported then. There are not too many takers for Indias top e-commerce firms at their current valuations, prompting both Flipkart and Snapdeal to approach Alibaba Group for cash. Early last year, Flipkart set a target of generating annualized gross merchandise value (GMV) of $8 billion by December. However, the companys current average monthly annualized GMV is roughly $5 billion, Mint reported on 17 February. This number, which includes sales at Flipkarts unit Myntra, indicates Flipkart missed its internal sales target.\n"

      "Baidu Shares Rise 14% On Revenue Beat:Baidu Inc. posted revenue that topped analysts estimates as the Chinese Internet search providers investments in mobile begin to bear fruit and attract advertising. Sales rose 33 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in the December quarter from a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement. That beat the average analyst estimate of 18.5 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mobile revenue made up 56 percent of total sales in the quarter, up from 42 percent a year earlier, Baidu said.The companys dominance in search as more users shift to using mobile devices is helping offset the impact of a Chinese economy growing at its slowest pace in 25 years. Chairman Robin Li is also investing in services such as home delivery and online video to drive growth beyond advertising and help Baidu compete with Alibaba and Tencent. Baidus American depositary receipts rose as much as 14 percent to $179.90 in extended U.S. trading after the results were released. The stock has lost 16 percent this year. Investors are keeping a close eye on Baidus margins. Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu are now vying for supremacy in an on-demand services industry primed for growth as more people turn to their smartphones or the Web to order food, schedule beauty treatments or hire helpers. Users of such services could rise 29 percent to 400 million by next year, according to Shanghai-based IResearch.The rising cost of competing in online services is spurring consolidation, including the combinations last year of fashion sites Meilishuo and Mogujie, travel-site operators Ctrip and Qunar, and group-buying startups Meituan.com and Dianping.com.Baidu has had to keep spending on its video-streaming service IQiyi and main online commerce site Nuomi to keep pace with Alibabas and Tencents expanding rival platforms. Chairman Li and another executive this month offered to buy Baidus entire 80.5 percent stake in the IQiyi business, a deal that will shore up the search giants margins while setting up a potential initial public offering for the unit.These bold steps help to reveal its core operating margins and the earning power of its monopoly-like search engine business, HSBC Securities analysts led by Chi Tsang wrote in a report. Selling IQiyi could expand Baidus operating margins to 26 percent this year from 20 percent, even while unabated spending on on-demand services erases about 30 percentage points of profitability, they estimated.\n",
      "Airbnb Admits It Removed 1,500 Listings in New York Before Releasing Data to Regulators:Before Airbnb Inc. shared data on its business in New York City, the home-rental website removed about 1,500 listings controlled by full-time landlords. The company disclosed the removals in a letter to New York state legislators on Wednesday as it faces criticism over becoming a platform for unregulated hotels. Airbnb said it kicked off 622 hosts as part of the effort in November. The cuts helped portray a rosier picture of its New York City operations in the data released in December. The company had not outlined the extent of its removals when it initially presented the data publicly. The deleted listings accounted for about 4 percent of those offered in the city. Josh Meltzer, the company's head of public policy in New York, wrote in the letter to legislators that the listings \"did not reflect Airbnb's vision for our community.\" Airbnb has faced questions from city officials who have said real-estate developers are using Airbnb to rent out homes instead of selling them to permanent residents. The practice risks driving up housing prices. Airbnb defeated a proposal in San Francisco last year that would have restricted the company's business in its hometown. Airbnb spent $8 million to fight the effort. \"In New York City, where housing prices and availability are a critical issue, we want to work with our community and policymakers to help prevent short-term rentals from impacting the availability and cost of permanent housing for city residents,\" Meltzer wrote in the letter. \"While home sharing has been around for centuries, our people-to-people home sharing platform is new. And Airbnb is a young company. We have learned that a one-size fits all approach to cities will not work.\" Along with the letter to New York lawmakers, Airbnb released updated data on its operations in the city. Of hosts renting their entire homes in New York City, 38 percent of revenue came from those listing two or more homes on the website. Hosts with six or more homes on Airbnb generated 6 percent of revenue.\n",
      "European Tech Scene Begins to Feel Silicon Valleys Woes:At the offices of Deliveroo, a food delivery start-up with headquarters in an upmarket neighborhood here, signs of activity are everywhere. The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about.The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.Over the last year, Mr. Shu has urged colleagues to be more circumspect with growth plans, forgoing rapid expansion in competitive markets like the United States to focus on places where Deliveroo already has a loyal following. And while the start-up has raised almost $200 million, employs roughly 400 people worldwide and operates in 12 countries, Mr. Shu says profitability  and not just aggressive growth to beat rivals to new markets  is increasingly important as the company moves beyond its British roots. The focus at Deliveroo is symptomatic of a change across many European start-ups. Just as in Silicon Valley, where a number of privately held tech companies have been stung by lower valuations and investor questions about their sustainability, that same unease has now reached Europes tech community, in a sign that a move away from soaring boom times in start-ups is going global.Driving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valleys start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown  exacerbated in Europe by the regions migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves. As a result, venture capitalists in Europe and farther afield are becoming more cautious about funding local start-ups that do not have proven business ideas.When Silicon Valley sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, said Fred Destin, a partner at the London office of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. Its only a matter of time before Europe faces the same issues that were seeing on the West Coast.In Europe, that is leading to situations like that of Powa Technologies. Last week , Powa, an e-commerce company based in London, entered into administration, a form of bankruptcy. The start-up had raised $175 million since 2013 but had failed to win enough customers for its mobile shopping technology. Deloitte, which is overseeing the sale of the companys assets, says it is now working to find buyers for the business.Truecaller, a Swedish start-up that had raised around $80 million for its caller ID smartphone application, recently laid off about 20 percent of its staff. A company spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs and said Truecaller remained committed to its business. And SwiftKey, a popular predictive typing smartphone application used by more than 300 million people worldwide, was bought by Microsoft this month for a reported $250 million, which was significantly less than what many of SwiftKeys investors had expected.You can already see more hesitance and lower valuations, Christian Reber, founder of 6Wunderkinder, a German start-up bought by Microsoft last year, said in an email. The market correction will continue, and thats not necessarily a bad thing.\n",
      "A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.:While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls. Its remarkable what they can do, said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. If you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, its fewer and fewer firms. It is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion. And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader  one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firms capital. In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop. Here is a small sample of Jane Streets main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (masters in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (masters in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelors in computer science, Carnegie Mellon). Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business. Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level. Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firms program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading. And to the degree that the super-shy Jane Street does has have a public face, it belongs to its chief technology officer, Yaron Minsky, who givesfrequent lectures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Carnegie Mellon, promoting the firms ability to manage risk by developing the best software around.\n",
      "New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms Online Content:China is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval. The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video. The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval. China already has some of the worlds most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years. One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apples Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.\n",

      "Zenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups:Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly. Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.These grand promises were bolstered by Zenefits early growth. Its annual recurring revenue  an accounting measure preferred by subscription-based software companies  reached $1 million by the end of 2013, the year Zenefits was founded. Recurring revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by late 2015. The exponential growth was catnip to investors. The start-up raised $500 million last year at a $4 billion valuation, one of the largest financing rounds in a year of mega-fundings. At one point, Andreessen Horowitz, Silicon Valleys pre-eminent venture firm, had invested more in Zenefits than in any other company. In total, Zenefits has raised about $581 million. Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics. Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrads exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits. Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founders misdeeds. Zenefits recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when its down). That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors.Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship  only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems. Growth was the only imperative.\n"

      "Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play:Tech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without. So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction. At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel Ready Player One is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsofts HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from Star Trek. Like many other people working in the tech space, Im not a creative person, said Palmer Luckey, 23, a co-founder of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Its nice that science fiction exists because these are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be. They come up with a lot of incredible ideas. Those ideas are especially relevant now, as some of the biggest technology companies are nearing a major push of a new generation of virtual reality products. In the next few months, virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and HTC go on sale. Venture capital money is pouring into the industry. But how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers. Science fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free, said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses. Techies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration. But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace  and often someone  they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters. Magic Leap, based in Dania Beach, Fla., and which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his seminal 1992 novel Snow Crash. In an interview, Mr. Stephenson  whose title is chief futurist  declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several content projects underway at the company.\n",
      "Mattel Unveils ThingMaker, A $300 3D Printer That Lets Kids Make Their Own Toys:Autodesk was tasked with building this app which early testers, including those at Toyland, have already described as fast, easy to navigate and ridiculously intuitive.Called ThingMaker Design, the app includes a variety of built-in character templates and easy-to-use tutorials that help novices get started. But it also allows for designing characters from scratch, once kids get the hang of things. The toys can be customized with different colors and textures, and will bend and twist in the app so you can get a feel for how theyll work after theyve been printed. The creations can be saved as images to the mobile devices Camera Roll, or uploaded to Google Drive or Dropbox. When a design is complete, the app lets you export the STL print files wirelessly to your at-home printer, whether Mattels or otherwise. The idea isnt just to print an object and be done, however  instead, kids will print parts that can be assembled to form larger creations, like dolls, robots, dinosaurs, scorpions, skeletons, bracelets or necklaces, for example. Whats interesting here is the potential for Mattel to tie into other childrens brands it already owns or licenses and bring them to life through 3D printing. Thats something the company says is on the roadmap, saying it will launch additional design content, including branded options at a later date. No actual brand names were announced, however, but there were hints that brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels were already being planned. The physical parts are printed in batches then assembled through ball-and-socket joints that snap together. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes for a small item, up to overnight (e.g. 6 6 to 8 hours) for a larger toy.Mattel says its ThingMaker 3D will use a hard PLA filament, but also hasnt yet announced the colors that will be available. According to reports from the Toy Fair, though, there were some two dozen colors on display. A spokesperson said the company may release other materials in the future.\n",
      "Creating a Computer Voice That People Like:The challenge of creating a computer personality is now one that a growing number of software designers are grappling with as computers become portable and users with busy hands and eyes increasingly use voice interaction.Machines are listening, understanding and speaking, and not just computers and smartphones. Voices have been added to a wide range of everyday objects like cars and toys, as well as household information appliances like the home-companion robots Pepper and Jibo, and Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo speaker device. A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called conversational agents, software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands. However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science. It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the uncanny valley, in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans. Beyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this prosody, the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language. Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence. The first experimental-research results  gained from employing machine-learning algorithms and huge databases of human emotions embedded in speech  are just becoming available to speech scientists.\n",
      "Pandora Is Said to Have Held Talks About Selling Itself:Pandora Media, the largest Internet radio service, has held discussions about selling the company, according to people briefed on the talks. Pandora is working with Morgan Stanley to meet with potential buyers, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The talks are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. For Pandora, it would be a curious time to sell. Its shares are yielding a market value of $1.8 billion, down from more than $7 billion two years ago. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since October. Pandora has the largest number of users for music streaming, but the competition is encroaching. Spotify is said to be arming itself with another $500 million in capital, and Apple Music recently surpassed 10 million paying users. Pandoras users peaked at 81.5 million at the end of 2014, and, after falling to about 78 million in the third quarter of 2015, ended the year with 81.1 million. The company is spending heavily to attract users, and its ability to make money from those users may be waning. In the third quarter, Pandora lowered its full-year financial guidance, expecting its adjusted earnings to be $51 million to $56 million, down from the $75 million to $85 million it projected in the quarter before. It has lots of users but cant grow revenue quickly enough, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. It is another stumbling pioneer.\n",
      "Twitter User Growth Comes to a Halt - Stock Down After Quarterly Earnings:On Wednesday, after many quarters of slowing user growth, Twitter said its monthly visitors in the fourth quarter totaled 320 million  exactly the same as the company reported in the previous quarter. While the number was up 9 percent from a year ago, when monthly active users stood at 288 million, the figures showed that Mr. Dorseys recent moves have made little impact in attracting users. The user figures overshadowed otherwise positive fourth-quarter earnings results. Twitter reported revenue of $710 million, up 48 percent from $479 million a year ago. Net loss narrowed to $90.2 million, or 13 cents a share, from a loss of $125 million, or 20 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. But Twitters outlook was lower than projected by Wall Street. The company estimated revenue of $595 million to $610 million in the current quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of $628 million. Shares of Twitter have been pummeled in the last year, dropping around 67 percent. The stock declined in after-hours trading on Wednesday.\n",
      "Amazon Building Global Delivery Business to Take On Alibaba:In recent weeks, speculation has mounted that Amazon.com Inc. plans to launch a global shipping and logistics operation that will compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.Asked about reports that the company was leasing planes and had registered an ocean freight booking business, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky downplayed Amazons ambitions last month in an earnings call. He said the company was simply looking to supplement its delivery partners -- not replace them -- during peak periods like the Christmas shopping season. Amazon documents reviewed by Bloomberg News reveal a far bolder plan.A 2013 report to Amazons senior management team proposed an aggressive global expansion of the companys Fulfillment By Amazon service, which provides storage, packing and shipping for independent merchants selling products on the companys website. The report envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York and London. The project, called Dragon Boat, is proceeding, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who asked not to be identified because the information isnt public. The ambitious strategy promises to turn FedEx and UPS into Amazon rivals, but also will pit the Seattle giant against Chinese counterpart Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Both companies are vying for dominance of the rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce market, which by 2020 is expected to swell into a $1 trillion industry serving 900 million shoppers, according to a June report from Accenture and AliResearch, Alibabas research arm. Amazons plan would culminate with the launch of a new venture called Global Supply Chain by Amazon, as soon as this year, the documents said. The new business will locate Amazon at the center of a logistics industry that involves not just shippers like FedEx and UPS but also legions of middlemen who handle cargo and paperwork associated with transnational trade. Amazon wants to bypass these brokers, amassing inventory from thousands of merchants around the world and then buying space on trucks, planes and ships at reduced rates. Merchants will be able to book cargo space online or via mobile devices, creating what Amazon described as a one click-ship for seamless international trade and shipping.\n",
      "Facebook Loses a Battle in India Over Its Free Basics Program:For years, Mark Zuckerberg has had a grander vision than just connecting the more than one billion people who already use Facebook: He wants to connect the entire world. That effort hit a major roadblock on Monday, when Indian regulators banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. The regulations, issued after months of intense public debate over how to extend the Internet to Indias poorest citizens, effectively block Facebooks controversial Free Basics program in the country. Free Basics offers people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet. Free Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerbergs program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the worlds tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative. Free Basics is now in 38 countries, from Indonesia to Panama. Facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap Wi-Fi to remote villages and to beam Internet service from high-flying drones. In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment. The program quickly became the target of critics, who said that it was an attempt to steer unsophisticated new Internet users to Facebook and other services that were working with the company. They argued that Free Basics and other so-called zero rating programs, which are a set of apps or sites that a mobile operator or I.S.P. does not charge customers to use, violated the concept of net neutrality. Facebook embarked on a blitz of paid lobbying and advertising to promote Free Basics, spending millions of dollars in media campaigns to convince locals its offering would be positive for the population. The company ran special banners in the Facebook news feeds of Indian users urging them to petition the government to allow Free Basics. Mr. Zuckerberg personally lobbied against the new rules, including writing an opinion column in The Times of India. Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking. Locals were wary of the companys unknown long-term plans for advertising or other parts of Facebooks business.\n"

      "Apple Said to Be on Course for Approval to Open Stores in India:Apple Inc. is on course to win clearance to open its first retail stores in India, a person with knowledge of the matter said, as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook seeks growth opportunities in a nation of 1.3 billion people. The Indian government plans to push through Apples application to set up outlets, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isnt public. The company is resubmitting the request as it wasnt in the right format, the person said, without giving a time-frame for final approval. Apple should qualify as a provider of cutting-edge technology, the person said. That would exempt the maker of iPhones and iPads from a rule forcing foreign businesses that retail a single brand in India to procure 30 percent of a products inputs locally. The company makes most of its devices in China. Cook is hunting for fresh sources of growth after Apple last month forecast a sales decline for the first time in more than a decade. India now has the worlds fastest-growing major economy and about 220 million smartphone users. The challenge is that Indian consumers tend to prefer cheaper devices, leaving Apple with only about 2 percent of the market. Apple uses re-sellers in India for its products. Domestic distributor Redington India Ltd. has dropped about 5 percent since Apple in January confirmed it had applied to open stores in Asias third-largest economy.\n",
      "LinkedIn Shares Plummet 30% After Sales Outlook Trails Estimates:LinkedIn Corp. shares lost almost a third of their value after the professional networking site forecast a year of slower revenue growth amid signs of weakness in sales of advertising and marketing tools. Revenue will be about $820 million in the first quarter, and $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion for 2016, the company said in a statement Thursday. That missed analysts average estimate for $867.1 million and $3.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn had 414 million users in the fourth quarter, up from 396 million in the prior period. While Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner has made investments to diversify the business, like acquiring education website Lynda.com for $1.5 billion last year, it will be a while before those efforts contribute meaningfully to revenue. In the meantime, LinkedIn is facing a slowdown in its marketing-services business, which companies use to find potential customers, show them ads and relevant information and generate sales leads. Sales to recruiters, who use LinkedIn to find candidates for jobs, are also slowing. LinkedIn is narrowing its focus in some areas, which is hurting sales. For example, its discontinuing a tool that helps marketers find leads, incorporating the technology into its sponsored content business instead, contributing to a slowdown in its marketing solutions business. Revenue in the marketing solutions division rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter to $183 million. The professional-networking website is also facing slower economic growth in Europe and Asia, though it said China is its fastest-growing country for new members. The company has a standalone app for Chinese users and has devoted much of its efforts over the past year to push deeper into that market. For the fourth quarter, LinkedIn reported a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.43 million, compared with the average estimate for $50.2 million. Revenue climbed 34 percent to $862 million, topping the prediction for $857.4 million.\n",
      "Lenovo Tumbles as Sputtering PC, Phone Demand Hammers Sales:Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged in Hong Kong trading after quarterly revenue declined for the first time in more than six years on stalling demand for phones and computers. Shares fell 10 percent in their biggest decline in two years. The worlds largest PC maker said revenue dropped 8 percent in the three months ended December, even as broadening cost cuts delivered a surprise rise in net income. Lenovo is relying on cutting $1.35 billion from annual costs and eliminating 3,200 jobs to shield its earnings from intensifying smartphone competition and a shrinking market for PCs. While its expanding into other businesses, the company still gets more than half of revenue from a market that Intel Corp. last month warned was off to a soft start in 2016 amid tepid economic growth. Focusing internationally helped Lenovo lift the proportion of smartphone shipments from outside China to 83 percent from 59 percent. Expansion into markets from India to the U.S. helped shore up margins even as its global market share slipped about 1.5 percentage points to 5.1 percent in the period. The company once hailed as a symbol of global ambitions for Chinese corporations now faces the twin challenges of a competitive global smartphone and PC environment and a home country growing at its slowest pace in a quarter-century.\n",
      "Magic Leap, an Augmented Reality Firm, Raises $793 Million:Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up based in Dania Beach, Fla., announced on Tuesday that it had raised a $793 million round of venture financing, valuing the company at $3.7 billion, excluding the new funds. The round comes during a race to discover and create the next breakout platform for consumers, which many of the worlds largest tech companies think will be some form of virtual reality. In 2014 Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus, a virtual reality company that plans to ship its first headsets to consumers in the coming weeks. Microsoft has been working on Hololens, and Apple is reportedly at work on its own efforts. But Magic Leap has drawn attention for the prominent investors it has attracted  Google, Fidelity Investments and Warner Brothers, among others  despite being almost completely closed off from showing the public any of its products. Only occasionally do the founders pop up to give interviews. This most recent round was led by Alibaba, the large Chinese e-commerce company, with participation from new investors including J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates. Magic Leap has raised more than $1 billion in funding to date.\n",
      "Alphabet, Googles Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close in on Apple:Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of a new conglomerate called Alphabet on Monday. Investors liked what they saw so much that the outfit formerly known as Google is poised to become the worlds most valuable company. Alphabets total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014. Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Googles core business is performing. The new disclosures, combined with its more investor-friendly tone and, of course, continued strong growth in its advertising business, are the main reasons Alphabet stock has jumped 43 percent from a year ago, putting it neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere. Or at least that was what happened with Amazon, which recently began separating its retail operations from the results of its highly profitable cloud computing business, and Netflix, which used segment reporting to show investors that while it might be losing money internationally, its North American streaming business is doing well. Advertising continues to account for the lions share of the companys revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising. This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Googles mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\n",
      "Microsoft Plumbs Oceans Depths to Test Underwater Data Center:Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industrys most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill. Todays data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash. Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity. The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity. Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage. The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the worlds population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users. The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule  eight feet in diameter  that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected. The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night. The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsofts Azure cloud computing service.\n",
      "Amazon shares plunge as record profit still misses estimates:Amazon.com Inc posted its most profitable quarter ever on Thursday but the world's No. 1 online retailer still managed to disappoint Wall Street by badly missing estimates, sending its shares down more than 13 percent in after-hours trading. The results, as well as the company's determination to invest more in new areas and its extremely low profit margins, brought back perennial questions for investors about the company's ability to consistently earn money. Amazon's net profit for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, rose to $482 million, or $1.00 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $214 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 21.8 percent to $35.75 billion, but missed analysts' expectations of $35.93 billion. Net sales from its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, rose 69.4 percent to $2.41 billion, compared with a growth of more than 78 percent in the third quarter. AWS continues to be the fastest growing division within Amazon. The company's total operating expenses rose more than 20 percent to $34.64 billion in the fourth quarter.\n"

Facebook shares rose almost 12 percent in after-hours trading to $105.32. The company said sales in the fourth quarter rose 52 percent from a year ago, to $5.84 billion, while profit increased to $1.56 billion, more than doubling from $701 million a year ago. For the full year, the company reported $3.69 billion in profit on $17.93 billion in revenue, an increase of 44 percent from 2014. The company has also begun monetizing some of its other units, such as photo-sharing app Instagram, which surpassed 400 million users last year and began selling ads in September. Facebook said mobile ads accounted for 80 percent of total ad revenue in the quarter, compared with about 78 percent in the third quarter and 69 percent a year earlier.The results offer a bright spot in a tumultuous climate for many American technology stocks. Shares of Twitter, Facebooks most visible social networking competitor in the United States, have tumbled more than 55 percent during the last year. Yelp, the local-review service, is down about 60 percent. LinkedIn, the professional social networking service, is off more than 15 percent. Facebook is a much larger company than many of its peers, yet it is able to keep its growth rate high. The company has notched double-digit jumps in ad revenue and in the expansion of its user base.

Apple forecast second-quarter revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion, below analysts' average forecast of $55.5 billion. In the same quarter last year Apple reported revenue of $58 billion. While revenue in Greater China rose 14 percent in the last quarter, Apple is beginning to see a shift in the economy, particularly in Hong Kong, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview. \"As we move into the March quarter it's becoming more apparent that there are some signs of economic softness,\" Maestri said. \"We are starting to see something that we have not seen before.\" The slowdown comes as Wall Street analysts worry the company does not have another blockbuster product to replace the iPhone. Apple does not report Watch sales, but it does not appear to have the makings of being a hit on the same level as the iPhone a year after launch. And while the company is reportedly working on a car, what it plans to do in that area and when are still unclear.

      "A Personality Profile of Larry Page: How Larry Pages Obsessions Became Googles Business:Three years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martins nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Googles Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him. They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction  that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the suns power  before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name. Im Larry Page, the man said. He realized he had been talking to Googles billionaire co-founder and chief executive. He didnt have any sort of pretension like he shouldnt be talking to me or Dont you know who youre talking to Mr. Chase said. We just talked. Larry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O  an annual gathering where the company unveils new products  is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors. But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Googles various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.\n",
      "Facing a Price War, Uber Bets on Volume: The U.S. operation cuts fares while promising imminent profit.Its becoming a bit of a holiday tradition for Uber: ringing in the new year by lowering fares. Amid a price war with rival Lyft, the ride-hailing leader reduced its rates by 10 percent to 45 percent in 100 cities across North America. In Detroit, Uber drivers per-mile rate is less than it takes to cover their gas and the depreciation of their cars, according to IRS figures. Its depressing, says Bill Scroggins, an Uber driver in Indianapolis. Im not even sure I want to drive anymore. It feels like Im doing it for free. This is the third year in a row Uber has discounted fares in January. It calls the cuts seasonal but says they could last indefinitely. Last year rates never rose again in almost a third of cities; only in two did they return to precut prices. Uber has instituted temporary hourly wage guarantees to limit drivers earnings declines. Its assured Scroggins and other outraged drivers theyll come out ahead by making more trips an hour thanks to increased demand. That may be what Uber is telling itself, too. A few months ago, Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick told employees that North American operations would turn a profit in the second quarter of this year. The goal sounds less realistic in light of the price cuts. Uber has to sacrifice profits for growth, says Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School. Uber is also churning through cash a lot faster than Lyft, having said it will spend billions to push its way into China, India, and Southeast Asia. In the first quarter of 2015, Uber lost $385.1 million on $287.3 million in revenue, according to leaked figures published by the Information, a tech news site. And losses are growing: In the third quarter, Uber lost $697 million on $498 million in revenue, according to a person briefed on the numbers. Over the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion on $1.2 billion in revenue. For perspective, during Amazon.coms worst-ever four quarters, in 2000, it lost $1.4 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue. CEO Jeff Bezos responded by firing more than 15 percent of his workforce.\n",
      "Techs Frightful 5 Will Dominate Digital Life for Foreseeable Future:Theres a little parlor game that people in Silicon Valley like to play. Lets call it, Whos Losing There are currently four undisputed rulers of the consumer technology industry: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, now a unit of a parent company called Alphabet. And theres one more, Microsoft, whose influence once looked on the wane, but which is now rebounding. So which of these five is losing A year ago, it was Google that looked to be in a tough spot as its ad business appeared more vulnerable to Facebooks rise. Now, Google is looking up, and its Apple, hit by rising worries about a slowdown in iPhone sales, that may be headed for some pain. Over the next couple of weeks, as these companies issue earnings that show how they finished 2015, the state of play may shift once more. But dont expect it to shift much. Asking whos losing misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech. Whos really losing In the larger picture, none of them  not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives. Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead. Consider that Netflix hosts its movies on Amazons cloud, and Googles venture capital arm has a huge investment in Uber. Or consider all the in-app payments that Apple and Google get from their app stores, and all the marketing dollars that Google and Facebook reap from start-ups looking to get you to download their stuff.

In tech jargon, they own many of the worlds most valuable platforms  the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.\n",
      "Why an Ex-Google Coder Makes Twice as Much Freelancing:With a talent war raging, companies from Airbnb to Pfizer are paying top dollar for the services of independent programmers. James Knight recently made an unorthodox career move for a 27-year-old coder: quitting a well-paid gig writing software for Google to go freelance. No more catered lunches, gold-plated benefits or million-dollar views from the search giants Manhattan office. Knight is willing to sacrifice those perks because as an independent hes pulling down about twice as much as he did at Google. Plus, he has more freedom. In March, Knight and his wife plan to travel to Spain and hopscotch across Europeall the while writing code for a dating app and a self-portrait app, among others. \"Id rather control my own destiny and take on the risk and forgo the benefits of nap pods and food,\" Knight says. Amid an accelerating war for tech talent, big companies and startups alike are paying top dollaras much as $1,000 a hour, according to a person who gets coders gigsfor freelancers with the right combination of skills. While companies still recruit many of the best minds, they're turning to independent software developers to get a stalled project moving or to gain a competitive edge. In some cases, the right person can be the difference between a failed and successful product. Last spring, Aaron Rubin hired a freelance coder through recruiter Toptal for about four weeks to help get ShipHero, his cloud-based logistics startup, off the ground. \"To find someone that talented in New York in three days was never going to happen,\" Rubin says. \"Every talented engineer I know has a job.\n",
      "Social media buy buttons are n't off to a great start, but they might still be big:In the past year, theres been a flurry of experimentation with buy buttons, a way for social-media sites to allow users to purchase cocktail dresses, throw blankets, candle-making kits and sundry other items from retailers without leaving the social network. Pinterest launched buyable pins in June, the same month Instagram released its similar shop now feature. Those offerings joined ongoing tests by Facebook and Twitter for similar functionality. The rush by tech giants and retailers to join the buy-button arms race would suggest that these businesses see money-making potential. And given how much time people spend on social media  an estimated 1 of every 5 minutes spent on a mobile phone in the United States is on Facebook or Instagram, for example  it would be logical to assume that these buy buttons are bringing retailers a blast of online sales. But this holiday season, social channels accounted for 1.8 percent of overall online sales, according to data from Custora, whose software platform is used by many retailers. Thats just a tiny sliver of purchases, and its not even growing: In 2014, Custora found that social media led to 1.9 percent of sales during the same time period. But even if buy buttons have not had an explosive launch, experts say they could prove to be a crucial solution to some of retailers biggest online shopping problems. Right now, stores are seeing a massive conversion gap on mobile devices, meaning that there has been a surge in the number of people browsing sites from mobile devices, but only a small share of them are actually making purchases. In studies, shoppers frequently say they dont buy on their smartphones because it is a hassle to enter payment information and go through a checkout process on the small screen. Buy buttons could also help retailers re-create the idea of the impulse buy for the online era. On the web, a shoppers journey so often begins with a search in Amazon or Google for a specific item. That has made it hard for retailers to do what theyve long done in stores with elaborate window displays and sweet treats near the checkout counter: Persuade you to buy something eye-catching on a whim.\n"

      "Intels Earnings Fall; Despite Exceeding Investor Expectations,slowing data center revenue growthsends shares down 5%:Intel Corp's (INTC.O) strong quarterly profit beat was overshadowed by concerns about slowing revenue growth in its highly profitable data center business, sending its shares down about 5.6 percent in after-market trading. In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the companys revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly. Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion. The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent. Intels share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening. Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014. On Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intels much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the companys operating profit margin. Keeping up with Moores Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion. Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moores Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip. If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements. Relax, said Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer of Intel. Moores Law is the heartbeat of our company, he said. It is the core of our competitive advantage.\n",
      "Parallels Between Netflix and Amazon:Netflix has grown substantially over the last few years, now claiming more than 70 million subscribers who pay about $8 to $10 a month for access to a large library of movies and TV shows. Last year the streaming services stock was the best performing of the Standard & Poors 500-stock index, rising 140 percent. And its prospects keep looking brighter: Last week, Reed Hastings, Netflixs goateed chief executive, announced he would make his movies and TV shows instantly available to almost every country in the world (the big exception, for now, is China). The move nearly doubled Netflixs potential market  the service is now accessible to more than 540 million households worldwide with broadband Internet access. On paper, Mr. Hastingss plan to take on the traditional TV industry has long sounded slightly nutty, as delusional as Jeff Bezoss strategy at Amazon to overrun retailing once seemed. Netflixs plan is certainly high risk  it is spending billions to create and license content, it is fighting determined media incumbents across the globe, and it owns none of the pipes leading into peoples homes. (Among Netflixs many competitors is Amazon itself, which has its own growing and well-regarded original-content division) A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others. Like Amazon, Netflix is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and its using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. And finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.\n",
      "Uber Invites Developers to Build Apps for Customized Passenger Distractions:Uber, the huge ride-hailing service, delivers millions of rides to passengers. Now the company wants to give people something to do while theyre in the car. On Tuesday, Uber introduced a way for smartphone app developers to create trip experiences for riders. The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle. Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride. What if developers could also offer users of their apps new ways to enjoy themselves  or get stuff done  while theyre on the road Chris Saad, head of product on Ubers developer platform, wrote in a company blog post. These integrations help make life simpler and easier for people to get around. Uber has long been selective about how it works with partner apps and companies. It has struck deals with Facebook, Foursquare and OpenTable to allow users to hail rides from inside the companies apps. Uber is also working with a handful of retailers in some cities for its delivery service, UberRush. For Uber, the goal is to make the user experience more pleasant than a usual ride, which may in turn drum up repeat business and affinity for the companys brand. The company has struck similar partnerships in the past, such as one with Spotify, in which users can select the songs being played during their Uber rides. This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developers trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past. The announcement coincided with Ubers first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas.\n",
      "Flipkart, Amazons India Rival, Changes CEOs:In a move that has been rumored for some time, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal has stepped down as CEO of the Indian e-commerce company, the company announced today. He will be replaced by his co-founder, Binny Bansal (no relation). Sachin Bansal will become executive chairman and mentor the senior leadership of the company and look for new investment opportunities, the company said in the announcement. Binny Bansal, formerly chief operating officer, will now run the business day to day. The move comes as competition for market share in Indias burgeoning online shopping industry has ramped up between Amazon, Flipkart and fellow Indian upstart Snapdeal. Amazon has promised to invest billions into its India business, which is run by Amit Agarwal, who spent two years earlier in his career working as Jeff Bezoss right-hand man.\n",
      "Zuckerberg Plea for Free Web in India Wins Support in Review:A majority of Indians who submitted comments to the nations telecommunications regulator said they support Facebook Inc.s Free Basics plan that would allow free Web access. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said that 1.35 million responses in support of the plan -- or 56 percent of all comments -- came from Facebooks @supportfreebasics.in, according to a report on the agencys review of different pricing for data services. It received another 544,000 responses from @facebookmail.com, with most backing Facebooks plan, the regulator said, without providing a percentage. Comments either supporting or opposing differential pricing were basically template responses\" and \"identical in nature,\" the regulator said Saturday on its website, without explaining how the views would be used in the review. The agencys chief, R.S. Sharma, told The Hindu newspaper in an interview published Jan. 1 that such responses were \"not helpful at all\" and didnt represent meaningful input. The regulator has appealed to respondents and Facebook to solicit more detailed opinions. Facebook Chairman Mark Zuckerberg made a personal appeal in one of Indias leading newspapers last month for the country to allow a free Internet service. Facebooks proposed Free Basics plan allows customers to access the social network and other services such as education, health care and employment listings from their phones without a data plan. Industry groups say the program threatens the principles of net neutrality and could change pricing in India for access to different websites.\n",

      "Facebooks Oculus Says It Will Charge $599 for the Rift:After months of teasing the introduction of its Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, the company said on Wednesday that it had opened orders for the system, which includes a headset and controller devices, with a price of $599. Thats without a computer included  youll need a fast one that will probably cost around $1,000. The device begins shipping in March. Oculus also said that in February, it would open orders for a bundle, which includes the Rift headgear system and a computer that is certified to work with Oculus, for $1,500. Oculus is just one of many companies preparing to offer virtual reality devices this year. HTC, the Taiwanese manufacturer, worked with the software distribution company Valve to develop the virtual reality gadget Vive that will be released in April. Similar to Oculus, the Vive requires connecting to a powerful computer, meaning the pricing should be similarly high. The companies have not announced the price yet. And Samsung Electronics teamed with Oculus last year to offer an entry-level virtual reality system, the Gear VR. That device, at $100, requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear because it relies on the smartphones screen for video and its computing brains for running apps and games.\n",
      "Apple falls on Nikkei report of ~30% iPhone production cuts:Apple is expected to cut production of its latest iPhone models by about 30 percent in the January-March quarter, the Nikkei reported. As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily reported. Apple's shares were down 2.2 percent at $102.97 in afternoon trading. The stock has lost about a quarter of its value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. \"This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. \"The Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.\" Apple shares fell on the report. Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit, which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time. Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple.\n",
      "Augmented Reality Versus Virtual Reality: Understand the Difference:The Battle Is Real: Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have existed in some form for decades, only recently have they garnered mainstream attention. VR is blowing up right now, and its content and hardware advances have been exciting to watch. In a short amount of time, content creators have made some mind-blowing advances in storytelling with this new technology. Brands, movie studios, gaming companies and news organizations are all tinkering with this tool and channel. VR will gain ascendancy throughout 2016, but my moneys on AR becoming the dominant technology in our daily lives. The New York Times recently distributed more than one million Google cardboards to its digital-edition subscribers. YouTube and Facebook are enabling VR online through digital video players. Everything is aligning to have VR hit critical mass next year. VR is the only medium that guarantees the users complete focus on the content. There is no looking away, no checking email or text messages and no updating social-media statuses. VR is the most immersive way to tell a story because what happens inside that headset makes you feel something in your head, heart and gut. But VRs biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. The immersive nature of VR hinders users from interacting with their surroundings. It takes them out of the moment. They cant walk around and see what is right next to them, look people in the eye or read someones body language. VR is a powerful way to experience content, but is not practical for interacting in the real world. And therein lies the major problem with VR. Content is king, no doubt, and providing immersive experiences is the holy grail in advertising. But VR will never become an innocuous part of our daily lives. AR adds contextual layers of information to our experiences in real time. We have seen this future foretold in Hollywood films, such as Avatar, Minority Report, Iron Man and Wall-E, among others. Soon these depictions will become real. However, AR has issues with execution, which tends to feel gimmicky. Remember pointing your smartphone to a print ad to get some poorly made content Google Glass showed some innovative AR applications, but they were ultimately a failure because the hardware and technology were too broad and lacked focus on the consumer problem they were trying to solve. These examples have shown the promise of AR, but have failed to deliver on contextual utility. Still, the future is bright for AR with several tech companies working on their AR offerings. Microsoft is working on HoloLens AR headset glasses. Developer kits are scheduled to hit the market in early 2016. Google invested in a company called Magic Leap, whose technology beams lasers into the viewers iris to activate AR. That future will become a reality in another years time. Both VR and AR tinker with our reality  but AR enhances it, while VR diverts us from it, which is why the latter will come to the fore in 2017, with its promise of contextual data for marketers and utility for consumers.\n",
      "Facebook fights for Free Basics in India, global test-case:India has become a battleground over the right to unrestricted Internet access, with local tech start-ups joining the front line against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his plan to roll out free Internet to the country's masses. The Indian government has ordered Facebook's Free Basics plan to be put on hold while it decides what to do. The program, launched in around three dozen developing countries, offers pared-down web services on mobile phones, along with access to Facebook's own social network and messaging services, without charge. But critics say the program, launched 10 months ago in India in collaboration with operator Reliance Communications, violates principles of net neutrality, the concept that all websites on the internet are treated equally. It would put small content providers and start-ups that don't participate in it at a disadvantage, they say. \"India is a test case for a company like Facebook and what happens here will affect the roll out of this service in other smaller countries where perhaps there is not so much awareness at present,\" said Mishi Choudhary, a New York-based lawyer who works on technology and Internet advocacy issues. Also at stake is Facebook's ambition to expand in its largest market outside the United States. Only 252 million of India's 1.3 billion people have Internet access, making it a growth market for firms including Google and Facebook.\n",
      "Few Computers Are Powerful Enough to Support Virtual Reality: VR headsets are almost ready to hit stores, but less than 1 percent of PCs will be capable of running them.Virtual reality has a very real problem. With several technology giants preparing splashy introductions for the first VR headsets in 2016, few people own hardware capable of fully supporting Facebooks Oculus Rift or other systems. Just 13 million PCs worldwide next year will have the graphics capabilities needed to run VR, according to an estimate by Nvidia, the largest maker of computer graphics chips. Those ultra-high-end machines account for less than 1 percent of the 1.43 billion PCs expected to be in use globally in 2016, according to research firm Gartner. VR headsets, which create immersive 3D environments the wearer can interact with and explore, are poised to be a star of CES 2016. The massive consumer electronics trade show, which kicks off in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, will have more than 40 exhibitors demonstrating VR products, a 77 percent increase from 2015. Taiwanese gadget maker HTC is expected to show off a new version of its Vive headset at CES before releasing it in stores in April. Facebook is still on track to sell its first VR product to consumers by the end of March, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey tweeted on Dec. 22. I think the technology has significant potential, but I also think we have to be realistic about how strongly it will be adopted in the short term, Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst for researcher IHS, wrote in an e-mail. The hype is somewhat understandable considering the investment some big technology companies are making in VR. However, VR headsets come to market with a number of specific challenges. IHS estimates that 7 million VR headsets will be in use by the end of 2016. The Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, forecasts VR headset sales of 1.2 million units in 2016. While that's a sixfold increase from last year with total revenue of $540 million, thats a ways short of covering the $2 billion Facebook paid for Oculus VR in 2014. Theres a very good reason why VR demands such processing power: Anything less, and you might hurl. Early VR prototypes caused many testers to suffer from motion sickness due to slight delays in the screens responses to the users movements. A standard PC game runs at 30 frames per second. But to deliver the fluid, natural motion our brains need to be convinced an image is real, VR needs to achieve 90 frames per second on two video projections (one for each eye). Right now, that means a $1,500 laptop.\n",
      "Instacarts crazy-growth days may be coming to an end:the$2 Billion Grocery Delivery Startup, Lays Off 12 In-House Recruiters: The grocery delivery startup, which investors valued at $2 billion last year, laid off 12 in-house recruiters earlier this month, according to multiple sources. A spokeswoman confirmed the layoffs, but did not disclose how many recruiters the company still employs. In a statement, CEO Apoorva Mehta attributed the job cuts to the companys plans to be less aggressive in hiring in 2016 than it was in 2015, when its staff tripled, from just under 100 employees to a little more than 300. A person familiar with the move, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the company likely should have employed fewer full-time recruiters and more contractors since it was unlikely that last years pace of hiring would continue indefinitely. Those affected by the cuts will be paid through the end of January, this person said. Instacart delivers groceries in 18 American cities from big chains like Whole Foods, Costco and Target and smaller grocers like Fairway and Zabars in New York City. Customers place orders through Instacarts website or app, and the goods are whisked from local stores to customer doors, usually within an hour. A substantial portion of Instacarts revenue originally came from marking up the in-store price of a given item, but the company now often charges the same price as the grocer, but takes a cut of the sales from the store. Earlier this year, Instacart finally began being transparent about when it was charging higher prices than its partner grocers.\n",

      "Apple Pay Seeks Growth in Asia, Europe After Slow U.S. Adoption:After a sluggish start in the U.S. since its debut more than a year ago, Apple Pay is ramping up in markets where people are more comfortable with so- called contactless payments. The service, which lets consumers pay in an app or by tapping their iPhone on store terminals, will be introduced next year in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain. Apple is counting on its brand recognition as it enters markets that are further along than the U.S. in all things mobile payments, particularly in advanced technologies needed to accept them in retail outlets. Still, it wont be easy. The iPhone maker will compete with local banks and Internet companies that already offer the service -- not to mention Samsung Electronics Co., the worlds leader in smartphones. The mobile-payment service, which only works with Apple devices, is a way for the company to make products more appealing and spur customer loyalty. After Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called 2015 the year of Apple Pay in January, the service has been slow to take off domestically, partly because of a lack of promotion and a limited number of store terminals able to accept it. China: Apple said its service will be rolled out as soon as early 2016.  Last week, Apple teamed up with Chinese bank-card association UnionPay, which will make Apples market entry a lot easier, said James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC. Still, Apple Pay will compete with services like Tencents WeChat and Alibabas Alipay that control more than 75 percent of the mobile-payments market. And Apple should be prepared to race with Samsung, which also announced a partnership with UnionPay and plans to bring Samsung Pay to China as soon as early 2016.\n",
      "Indian Regulators Suspend Facebooks Free Basic Services:Telecommunications regulators in India have ordered the suspension of Facebooks controversial program to bring free basic Internet services to mobile phone users in the country. Facebooks program, called Free Basics, is one of the signature projects of Internet.org, the companys ambitious plan to bring the Internet to the billions of people around the world who do not have it. Under the initiative, the company works in partnership with local telephone carriers in 35 countries to offer free access to a text-only version of the Facebook social network as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. The idea is to give novices a taste of the Internet and encourage them to buy paid data services when they want to explore the Internet more widely. But critics say that by offering a free package of handpicked services, Facebook and its partners are discouraging people from using competing services and violating the principle of net neutrality, which calls for telecommunications carriers to treat all Internet services equally. In India, for example, the program offers free web searches using Microsofts Bing service but Google searches incur a charge. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, has been particularly keen to expand Free Basics in India, which already has more Facebook users than any other country except the United States. Facebook has waged an aggressive advertising campaign in newspapers and on its own social network to build support for the program. But Facebook has encountered a series of setbacks, including intense opposition from net neutrality advocates, the poor marketing efforts and weak network of its Indian phone partner, and skepticism from regulators. One of those regulators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, has now told Reliance Communications, Facebooks partner in India, to stop offering Free Basics. The order  which was quietly issued about two weeks ago but leaked to the Indian news media this week  came after Reliance failed to turn over information about the terms and conditions of the service, which it had planned to expand across the country beginning last month.\n",
      "Elon Musk's SpaceX Successfully Lands Rocket After Launch of Satellites Into Orbit:People living along the central Atlantic coast of Florida have for decades enjoyed the spectacle of rockets headed for space. On Monday night, they were treated to a new sight that may become common: a rocket coming back down to a gentle landing. It really felt like it was right on top of us, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX for short, said during a telephone news conference afterward. For SpaceX, the 8:29 p.m. liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was a threefold success. First, it marked the companys return to flight after half a year. In SpaceXs last launch attempt, a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station disintegrated. Second, SpaceXs upgraded design for its Falcon 9 rocket worked flawlessly. The liquid oxygen was chilled to minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit, about 40 degrees colder than on earlier flights, and the kerosene fuel was cooled to 20 degrees instead of 70 degrees. Most significant to SpaceXs ambitions, however, is that after the second stage of the rocket with the satellites continued on to orbit, the engines of the booster stage reignited to turn it around, back to Cape Canaveral. Currently, most rockets are launched just once, the boosters falling back to Earth as expensive junk. Making spaceflight more like air travel, with rockets capable of being refueled and sent up again, is essential for SpaceXs long-term goal of sending people to Mars. Its all the difference in the world, Mr. Musk said, absolutely fundamental.\n",
      "Cisco reviews code after Juniper code backdoor found; more scrutiny expected:Networking equipment maker Cisco said on Monday it has launched a product review to look for tampering after rival Juniper Networks's disclosure found code in firewall software that made it vulnerable to cyber attacks. Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered \"unauthorized code\" in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices. That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week's unprecedented news from Juniper. It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized 'back door,\" or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper \"back door\" might impact government networks.\n",

      "Big IPO, Tiny Payout for Many Startup Workers:Side deals and volatile shares make stock options a bigger gamble for startup employees.The frustrated expectations of early employees have become a common thread in the latest round of technology IPOs. It used to be the get-rich story happened for people who joined in the early days, says Saar Gur, general partner at Charles River Ventures. Now they can be among the few left behind. Many executives, early investors, and even later investors are able to cash out before the rank and file, or bargain for guarantees that help ensure a bonanza. Whatever happens with an IPO, executives tend to hang on to enough equity to guarantee huge payouts when they sell their shares. Most early investors get a chance to sell options on secondary markets before a companys IPO. Later investors increasingly demand preferential treatment, including agreements that if an IPO underperforms the terms of their investment, theyll be made whole with an equivalent amount of additional shares. Late-stage investors in both Box and Square had such so-called ratchet agreements in place, further devaluing locked-up employee equity. When those kinds of deals are in place, employees often find their payouts disappointing because theyre so diluted, says Clara Sieg, a partner at Revolution Ventures. Box and Square declined to comment for this story. Ordinary employees are typically without meaningful financial protections or even a clear sense of what their equity stakes mean, says Chris Zaharis, whos worked at startups for about 20 years and as a volunteer teaches people about their equity rights. Options grants often dont come with information on strike prices (discounts on shares), preferential treatment, or even the total number of shares outstanding. People on average overestimate what they are going to make by about 10X, he says.\n",
      "Fed Raises Key Interest Rate for First Time in Almost a Decade:The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark interest rate, a vote of confidence in the American economy. Policy makers have waited a long time for this moment: Since December 2008 the Fed has held the benchmark rate near zero, the centerpiece of its campaign to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment from the recession. Fed officials predicted that they would raise interest rates by about one percentage point a year over the next three years  an indication that they would be taking a slow-and-steady approach to economic expansion. The cost of borrowing is expected to rise, but only slightly, with variable effects on what banks charge for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and some student loans. Remember, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said the Fed will move cautiously in raising its benchmark rate. Financial markets were encouraged by the Feds announcement. Stocks rose, the dollar gained modestly and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly. The Feds announcement came exactly seven years to the day after the central bank cut its benchmark rate nearly to zero.\n"

      "Is Acqui-Hiring Dead Tech Startups Long for the Days of Yahoos Binge Acquisitions:Under Marissa Mayer, Yahoo used to be the top company making acqui-hires, but such talent acquisitions have fallen out of favor throughout Silicon Valley this year. In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo was the top technology company conducting acqui-hires, an industry term for acquisitions done primarily for the talent, according to research firm CB Insights. Yahoo was tied for third in 2012, Mayer's first year at the company. In 2015, Yahoo has disappeared from the list entirely. When Mayer joined from Google, she was looking for an infusion of technical and entrepreneurial talent to improve the company's mobile and Web services. The fresh blood failed to revive the staid Internet portal, and now Yahoo is considering a spinoff of its core Web business to address investors' tax concerns. \"They made acquisitions, and nothing came out of it,\" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. \"The focus has shifted over the last few quarters to integrate, rather than acquire.\" Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment. The excitement surrounding talent acquisitions has dissipated throughout Silicon Valley, not just at Yahoo. Active acquirers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have started to pull back on buying for talent, CB Insights said. U.S. talent acquisitions have declined 48 percent this year from a peak in 2013, the firm's data show. CB Insights compiled the information from company reports, which wouldn't include undisclosed purchases or those not classified as talent acquisitions. Instead of pursuing costly acqui-hires, many companies have returned to old-fashioned recruitment, said Ben Narasin, a general partner at Canvas Ventures. \"All of these top firms need more people, but are you really willing to pay a million-dollar cost of acquisition for a whole bunch of people\" he said. \"I think acqui-hiring is dead.\"\n",
      "Twitter Aims to Show Advertising to Much Wider Audience:Twitter has long argued that its reach and influence extends far beyond the 320 million people who log into its social media service at least once a month. Tweets are embedded on thousands of other websites and apps, emailed, displayed on television and published in newspapers. Now the company plans to start making money from the vast number of people who are not signed in to the service but may click on a tweet they find through a web search or that is sent to them via email or text  an audience Twitter estimates at more than 500 million people worldwide. In a blog post on Thursday, the company said it has begun showing advertising to some of those casual viewers when they click on the link to a tweet or visit a Twitter users profile page. About 60 advertisers are participating initially, with the ads, known as promoted tweets, aimed at people in the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia. But the program, which has been in development for more than a year, is expected to ramp up quickly. These ads, which will be on the desktop web version of Twitter at first, wont be quite as finely targeted as typical Twitter ads, relying on context, like other pages people have recently browsed, for targeting. Twitter estimates that each of these logged out users could be worth $2.50 a year to advertisers, compared with about $4 a year for active users. Wall Street, which has been focused mostly on Twitters lack of growth in active users, sees lots of potential in the program, and Twitters stock rose almost 7 percent on Thursday.\n",

      "Its Come to This: Yahoos Future Now Hinges on Taxes (And Not Products):Yahoo is not going to spin off its 15% stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to sources cited by CNBC. Instead, Yahoo is going to look into selling its core Internet business. Yahoos core business includes its web properties, apps, search, media, ad business, etc. Yahoos 15% stake in Alibaba is worth around $32 billion, while its core Internet business is worth anywhere between $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion, according to analysts. Internet companies are about a lot of things, but primarily their success hinges on making great and innovative products. And unless the execution of getting those offerings out is just abysmal, this trumps all in Silicon Valley. That was the alleged promise of bringing in Google wunderkind Marissa Mayer as Yahoo CEO more than four years ago. Now the companys fate seems in the hands of tax attorneys, rather than entrepreneurs, which tells you all you need to know about Yahoo at the end of 2015. Last week, Re/code and others reported that the board of the Internet giant was seriously considering pausing the spinoff of its enormously valuable stake in Chinas Alibaba Group. The reason: While Mayer and Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman were assured by their pricey tax advisers at Skadden Arps that the transaction would be tax-free, the Internal Revenue Service would not provide any guarantee of that. No spinoff puts Yahoo into play in a very significant way, even if the board does not say so.

In it, Verily laid out a multidisciplinary approach to health and longevity, describing disease as a continuum that will be fought with experts from different fields and divisions working on hardware such as medical devices, software that might use algorithms to look for health patterns, as well as clinical studies like the Baseline Study of health and disease. The new name for the business is part of Googles transition to a holding company structure under the parent entity dubbed Alphabet. For those keeping track of Alphabets soup of operating companies, Verily is the division that was the Life Sciences unit of Googles X lab. Life Sciences graduated from Google X shortly after Google announced the Alphabet structure. Verily means truth or truly and the name, according to the spokeswoman, is meant to underscore the companys mission toreveal a true picture of health and disease.Background: For years, Google has been entering new businesses, but struggling to recreate the success it enjoys in search and advertising. In August, Google announced that it would create a new org structure where its traditional businesses (search, advertising, YouTube, maps) would continue to be called Google, while all other businesses would become separate companies. The parent of all of these companies would be called Alphabet. The idea is that the new businesses would get more room to grow and innovate like startups, while the traditional businesses would get higher stock market valuations because of their incredible profitability and size.\n"

      "Mother-Son Team Demo Translate For Code:Meet Roslyn Scott and Dalton Scott, a mother and son team who just demoed a neat idea for making code more accessible, here at the Disrupt London 2015 hackathon. Their hack, called the Human Code Project, uses several IBM Watson APIs, including its Natural Language Classifier, to power a search interface for translating JavaScript code terms into plain English. Its designed much like a language translation interface, so someone whos trying to understand what a piece of code is doing can search for a particular Javascript word or phrase within that code to see a definition of what a term such as onclick might mean in that particular context. The interface returns a percentage breakdown of how confident the system is in its definition for that term. During the hackathon they uploaded a training document to Watson, and created two classifier sets  one for definitions of code terms and one for phrases, explains Roslyn.\n",
      "Uber Valuation Put at $62.5 Billion After a New Investment Round - Tiger Global, Investor in Uber's Rivals, Joins In:Ubers fund-raising efforts are showing no signs of slowing down. The company, based in San Francisco, is close to completing the raising of a $2.1 billion round of venture capital, according to people briefed on the companys plans, the companys single largest round to date. Once completed, the investment will value the company at $62.5 billion, according to three people briefed on the plans, securing Ubers place as the worlds most valuable private start-up. Tiger Global Management participated in the newest round, led by its partner Lee Fixel, as did T. Rowe Price, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms are still private. Talks of the funding plans were previously reported by The New York Times in October. On Thursday, Bloomberg News reported the $62.5 billion valuation. Competition is intensifying in the global ride-hailing market, as rivals like Lyft, Didi Kuaidi and other companies raise billions of dollars in to expand as quickly as possible. Lyft, another ride-hailing start-up, is in talks to raise a further $500 million in funding, according to four people briefed on the round, which could value the company at roughly $4 billion. Didi Kuaidi, to date, has raised more than $4 billion in private investment. The participation of Tiger Global, however, is particularly interesting. Tiger Global is an investor in Ola and GrabTaxi, two of Ubers largest competitors in India and Southeast Asia. It is perhaps the first time a major institutional investor participated in the rounds of both Uber and its major competitors. And on Thursday, Ola and GrabTaxi announced a strategic partnership with Lyft, which is also based in San Francisco and is Ubers major competitor in the United States.\n",
      "Startup Founders Sound Just as Pessimistic About a Bubble as Tech Journalists:There has been a lot of kvetching of late about whether or not were in the middle of another tech bubble, and most of the pontificating has come from venture capitalists and tech media. But what do people who launch startups actually think According to First Round Capitals new State of Startups Report  a survey of more than 500 founders of VC-backed companies  founders are also largely convinced were in a tech bubble of some sort. First Rounds findings indicate that startup leaders are having a harder time raising money and that they think its only going to get tougher. The report also says they believe bitcoin is one really overhyped technology, whereas self-driving cars dont get enough attention. Weve embedded the report in a slideshow below, but here are some key facts and figures from First Round: 80 percent of founders say they were able to raise what they wanted to in their last rounds, but virtually all of them say that it will be harder to do so in the next year. 73 percent of startup founders believe we are in a bubble, but enterprise startup leaders are twice as likely to say we arent (twice as many enterprise tech founders also say theyll be profitable in the next year). No one has a clue about what the IPO market will look like in 2016: One third says there will be more IPOs, one third says itll be about the same and one third says there will be fewer. 90 percent of founders expect to see more tech mergers and acquisitions over the next year, which is also whats generally expected by industry analysts and experts.\n",
      "Yahoo shares spike 6% on reports board to weigh selling core business, Marissa Mayer's future role: WSJ. The board of Web giant Yahoo is set to discuss the company's future, and that of high-profile Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, when it meets this week, The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday. People familiar with the matter told the newspaper the board was expected to discuss during meetings from Wednesday through Friday whether to proceed with a plan to spin off more than $30 billion in shares of Alibaba or find a buyer for its core business of web properties, or both. Yahoo's core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank analysts have said in the past. The news comes as Mayer faces growing pressure over the company's performance. Mayer came to Yahoo after a long stint at Google. The company's shares were up more than 6 percent in extended trading.\n",
      "Holiday Shopping Is Chilly for Buy Buttons at Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest:More than a year after Twitter and Facebook began placing Buy buttons on their social networks, their e-commerce initiatives still appear to be relegated to experimental side projects. And at Pinterest, the tech platform that many believe is most conducive to e-commerce, one of its mainstream launch partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day via so-called Buyable Pins. The lack of aggressiveness on the part of Facebook and Twitter, and tepid early results at Pinterest, highlight the myriad challenges all three platforms face in transforming their immense user bases into shoppers. The sluggishness of the combined efforts also serves as a warning to other industry players betting big on the idea of social commerce that its still unclear if consumers will make purchases in big numbers on platforms that arent mainly retail destinations. Spokespeople for the three companies declined to disclose sales numbers for these initiatives. While each platform had its own reasons for pursuing e-commerce initiatives, the central idea was that they thought there was an opportunity to make it easier for their users to buy a product when they discover it on the platform. In theory, the usefulnesses of such a feature would be the biggest on mobile phones, where clicking through to make a purchase on another site can make purchases less likely because of uneven mobile webpage experiences. Facebook was the first to take a crack. Sixteen months after Facebook first began testing Buy buttons on ads and regular posts to let people purchase products they discover on Facebook without leaving Facebook, the initiative is still being dubbed a beta test, restricted solely to online merchants who work with e-commerce software provider Shopify. The company has also recently added purchase capabilities to some Facebook business pages and to a dedicated shopping section of Facebook, but these features, too, are being characterized as tests that arent available to all Facebook users in the U.S. At Twitter, its still unclear how big of a priority e-commerce will be going forward under the leadership of new CEO Jack Dorsey. The company began placing Buy buttons in tweets in September of 2014, and struck partnerships in October of this year with software partners such as Bigcommerce and Stripe to get more merchants on board. Best Buy, for example, will soon join the program  just not in time for the just-passed Black Friday weekend. But regular Twitter users can still go weeks without seeing any tweets enabled with e-commerce; most Re/code colleagues I polled, who are absolute Twitter power users, said they never come across them at all. Then theres Pinterest, the massive tech platform that retailers were most excited about for its e-commerce potential. The company began inserting Buyable Pins into its iPhone app in late June, and just added the feature to its Android app in early November. The company says more than 10,000 merchants have joined the program, including big retailers and brands like Macys, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Cole Haan and Tory Burch, but at least one of these big partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day on Pinterest, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sales figures. This source and another also said that Pinterest insiders have privately admitted to being disappointed with early sales numbers.\n",
      "Thanksgiving Final Results  OmniChannel Strikes Back:This morning we are releasing the final results from Thanksgiving 2015. What stands out is the Omnichannel players with stores and online marketplaces (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) did extremely well. This indicates that these Brick and Clicks retailers were really able to tie their store and online promotions together with great success. This data is date-shifted to compare Thanksgiving this year (Nov 26) vs. last year (Nov 27). In summary, Thanksgiving 2015 blew the doors off, coming in at 43.4% y/y growth compared to 20.1% last year  more than twice the rate of growth. The trick is while we know that Thanksgiving 2015 was very strong, we dont know if this will continue through the entire Cyber Five and through all of Holiday 15, or if consumers are shopping much earlier than last year and will taper off as we get past Thanksgiving. Omnichannel marketplaces led the pack with Google Shopping and Amazon also outperforming. From a device perspective, Smartphones were 58% of traffic compared to last years Thanksgiving 35% and a new high water mark for this device type in our data. From an order perspective, smartphone came in at 37% which was also more than double last year, although conversion rates continue to lag desktop and tablet considerably. Conclusion: consumers not only increased their Thanksgiving sales, but they utilized their smartphones heavily and favored omnichannel retailers.\n",
      "Indias Grofers Grabs $120M To Bring Offline Merchants Into The On-Demand World:The race for on-demand delivery services in India is on, and today one of the bigger startups in the market has picked up a large cash injection as it goes for pole position. Grofers, an Instacart-style app that links up with local, offline merchants to delivery groceries, medicine, flowers, and other daily items to customers, has raised $120 million led by new investor SoftBank. The Series C round also included existing backers DSTs Apoletto Managers, Tiger Global and Instacart investor Sequoia Capital. Grofers CEO and co-founder Albinder Dhindsa and SoftBank have both directly confirmed the round and investors to TechCrunch. Grofers has been on a fundraising tear to aid its expansion. This is the third round raised by the company this year alone, after earlier rounds of $10 million and $35 million. It brings the total to just under $166 million including an earlier seed round. Japans Softbank has been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into Indian startups like Ola, Snapdeal and more, and as part of this round it will take a seat on Grofers board. The Times of India, which first reported the raise, cites sources that say Grofers now has a post-money valuation of over $300 million. Dhindsa, who cofounded the company with Saurabh Kumar, would not comment on the valuation and said he hadnt even wanted to make this fundraise public. Very honestly its just a distraction for the team, he told TechCrunch. Were in the middle of trying to build a business. Today, that business is currently live in 26 cities in India, with some 1.6 million downloads of the mobile apps that are used to order its services. While Grofers looks on the surface like another Instacart clone, there is more going on under the hood. The company originally started as a B2B provider of a supply chain platform it built to help larger brands distribute consumables to smaller merchants, and for those smaller merchants who are almost completely offline to better keep track of their stock. In India, retail is very unorganised, so we see an opportunity in helping small merchants come online, Dhindsa says. Still, perhaps to tap into a more mass market prospect, it recently pivoted  or expanded may be the more accurate term  to make its business more consumer-facing, by offering those small, offline businesses an additional service: a way of showing their stock to consumers, who can order and have items delivered. Typically, Grofers offers some features to businesses for free, such as its inventory management system. It then takes a cut on other business software and services, as well as on the delivery, which can range at prices to consumers of between $1 for groceries to $0.40 for medicines (not as cheap sounding in India as it may be in the U.S.). Dhindsa says that the funding will be used to continue growing its supply-chain management development, but also to continue building out its last-mile infrastructure. Today, Grofers uses a mix of its own employees and contractors to deliver goods. Perhaps cleverly, it has chosen not to make delivery the cost-and-profit focus of its whole operation. In fact, its even considered partnering with others for that aspect of its business.\n"

      "Xiaomi's $45 Billion Valuation Seen `Unfeasible' as Growth Cools:Things were going so well for Xiaomi Corp. Customers were lining up, investors were swooning and the Beijing-based startup closed funding at a $45 billion valuation. That was last year. Now the high-flying smartphone maker is stumbling. Founder Lei Juns latest business, one of Chinas most exciting startup stories of the past few years, is likely to miss its own goal of selling 80 million smartphones this year, according to two people with knowledge of its production plans. Suppliers also cut their internal targets for Xiaomi in anticipation of the shortfall, they said. Xiaomis falter shows the startups challenge in trying to maintain momentum after a meteoric ascent past Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. Investors bought into the companys story of youthful disruption and online sales, yet the subsequent lowering of Chinas growth target and the copying of its sales strategy by rivals have neutralized Xiaomis first-mover advantage, putting its high price tag in doubt. \"All those expectations of growth arent being realized, which now makes that $45 billion valuation unfeasible,\" said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"The argument was that their business is kind of like Apple and theyre growing very fast, but theyre no longer growing so fast and theyre not as good as Apple.\" Domestic shipments of Xiaomi smartphones, including its premium Mi 4 and more economical Redmi series, dropped 8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its first-ever decline, according to researcher Canalys. IHS, another research firm, estimates that Xiaomi shipments dropped 3.9 percent, barely maintaining the lead over Huawei Technologies Co. Thats a big change from the bold growth projections used to justify Xiaomis tag as one of the worlds most-valuable technology startups. In March of last year, Lei predicted selling 100 million smartphones in 2015. Through the first nine months of this year, Xiaomi shipped about 53 million smartphones. With its optimistic forecast, Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in December from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd. and DST. Xiaomi drew comparisons to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company that months earlier held the largest initial public offering ever.\n",
      "Apple plans to launch Apple Pay in China by February: WSJApple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to launch its mobile payment system Apple Pay in China by early February, the Wall Street Journal reported. The iPhone maker has struck deals recently with China's big four state-run banks, the newspaper reported late Monday, citing people familiar with the discussions. When launched, Apple Pay will mainly compete with Alipay, the online payment platform run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that has a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. Apple's plans could still face regulatory hurdles in China, where banking and e-commerce are overseen by a number of government agencies, WSJ said. Launched in the United States in October last year, Apple is bringing its payment service to China, the most important market for smartphones. The company's sales nearly doubled in Greater China in its fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. The amount Apple would make off such transactions has been a sticking point in negotiations to bring Apple Pay to China, the Journal quoted the people as saying.\n",

Under the proposal, most drone owners would have to register the machines with the federal government, which would place the information in a national database, the first such requirements. The recommendations, from a task force created by the agency, would be the biggest step yet by the government to deal with the proliferation of recreational drones, which are usually used for harmless purposes but have also been tools for mischief and serious wrongdoing, and pose a risk to airborne jets. The F.A.A. is widely expected to approve the bulk of the recommendations in the next month, just in time for Christmas.

      "Once Valued At $4.5B, LivingSocial Offers a Cautionary Tale to Todays Unicorns:The first thing you see when walking into the headquarters of LivingSocial is row upon row of mostly empty desks, broken up by small street signs that employees once needed to find one another when the office teemed with people. One row, BYFAD Lane, was named after a start-up, BuyYourFriendADrink, which LivingSocial acquired to get into the daily deals business. Other signs, such as Sky Diving Street, were named for some of the hottest discount coupons that the company once provided. On a recent visit, some desks were piled high with boxes of employee belongings, the detritus left behind after a round of layoffs that eliminated one-fifth of the work force. In one refrigerator, the milk was six months old. The technology industrys boom over the last few years has been defined by the rise of unicorns, the private companies that investors have valued at $1 billion or more. Before the term came into vogue, LivingSocial was among the biggest unicorns of its day. It now offers a glimpse of what some of todays unicorns might look like several years down the road if things go awry. Just four years ago, LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon grew rapidly on a simple pitch: The companies would match customers to local businesses with a daily deal in users inboxes, like half off at a local deli or a two-for-one massage promotion. LivingSocial and Groupon would take a cut of each transaction. Venture capitalists anointed daily deals as the way that the Internet would invade local business, and by late 2011 LivingSocial had raised more than $800 million and reached a valuation of $4.5 billion, according to data from the research firm VC Experts. The company counted Amazon and the mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price among its investors. LivingSocial spent heavily, blanketing the airwaves with TV ad campaigns. Riding a wave of momentum, the company explored going public. Today, LivingSocial is more unicorpse than unicorn. The company never filed for an initial public offering and consumer fervor for daily deals has cooled. T. Rowe Price has written down its stake in LivingSocial to nearly zero, data from Morningstar shows. The companys work force has shrunk to around 800 employees from 4,500 at its peak in 2011. Groupon, which did go public, is trading at more than 85 percent below its I.P.O. price.\n",
      "Successful Tech IPO#1:Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering:Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07. The first-day pop followed a turbulent I.P.O. process for the six-year-old company, one that was marred by questions over pricing and valuation and that arrived in the face of a precarious public market for technology offerings. On Wednesday, when Square had priced its shares at $9, that was lower than the $11 to $13 range it had set, putting its valuation at $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion price tag that private investors had valued the company at last year. As recently as Wednesday, advisers laid out options for Square including pulling the deal, three people briefed on the discussions said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but for Square, that was not a consideration. We have a great beginning, said Jack Dorsey, Squares chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday. I dont see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work. The I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties  some might say guesswork  of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up. I want to get back to a steady state and back to business, Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Squares strategy now was to continue to save people trips to the bank. Were not going out there to say were getting rid of the banks or card networks. Weve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.\n",
      "Square prices shares at 52% discount to last valuation in disappointing turn to long-awaited IPO: sources:Mobile payments company Square Inc priced shares at $9 late on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter, further discounting the company's valuation before it begins trading Thursday morning. Square has raised $243.5 million in its Wall Street debut, about $80 million less than expected. The price set on Wednesday puts Square's market capitalization at $2.9 billion, a 52 percent drop from the $6 billion valuation it had earned at its last private funding round. San Francisco-based Square, led by CEO Jack Dorsey, earlier this month set a price range of $11 to $13, well below the $15.46 per-share price of its most recent private financing. The steeper discount to $9 - a 42 percent drop from what investors were willing to pay a year ago - suggests widespread uncertainty about the profitability of the payments industry and the future of Square itself, which has seen slowing revenue growth. \"The way that Square was valued as a private company is they were just going to disrupt everything and change payments,\" said Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, an exchange-traded fund for mobile payments companies. \"And the reality is not that.\" Compounding concerns is Dorsey's dual role running Twitter Inc., a social media company struggling for a turnaround. Founded in 2009, the company started as a way for small businesses to accept credit card payments through mobile devices. It has evolved to a suite of small business services, relying on partnerships with companies such as Apple and Visa. The valuation cut triggered a ratchet, or protection investors wrote into previous funding rounds, that requires Square to sell several million additional shares. Square will begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SQ\". Square is one of the most prominent \"unicorns,\" or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, to plan a public debut this year. Many have held up Square as an example of how fleeting - and at times nonsensical - private market valuations can be. There are more than 140 \"unicorns\" globally.\n",
      "Earnest, Fueled by Growth in Student Loans, Raises $275 Million: At the start of this year, Earnest was an intriguing but small entrant in an emerging field of start-ups using new tools of data and software to analyze credit risk and make consumer loans. Its loans were typically a few thousand dollars for things like relocation expenses and professional training. But today, the lender, based in San Francisco, is growing at a torrid pace, and on Tuesday it announced a $275 million round of debt and equity to fund further expansion. Already this year, Earnest has made 50 times as many loans as last year, and it is lending from $2 million to $5 million every day, said Louis Beryl, a co-founder and chief executive. In this round, $75 million is equity investment, and $200 million is debt funding. The debt portion is led by New York Life. The new financing brings the total raised by Earnest, founded in 2013, to $325 million. Earnest now employees 165 people, up from 30 at the start of this year. Mr. Beryl says he plans to hire about 200 more employees over the next year, especially technical people like software engineers, data scientists and user-experience designers. The long-term goal, he said, is to build a platform for the next generation of consumer financial services. The financial service that has carried Earnest so far is refinancing student loans, which it began at the end of January. It is by far the largest part of the companys business, and Earnests success points to the opportunity in services to ease the burden on the nations debt-laden students and recent graduates. Student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, growing by about 10 percent a year. Student loans are held by 40 million Americans. Earnest is focusing on the more indebted recent graduates. The size of its average refinancing loan is $70,000. The start-up says the average saving, on its refinanced loans, is $18,000, typically over 10 years. Other online lenders, like SoFi and CommonBond, have also done well in the market for refinancing student loans. But Earnest says its approach is particularly data-intensive, which it says allows it to tailor rates to individual circumstances. It asks its customers for digital links to their bank, credit card and retirement and investment accounts, and information on all their loans. They are willing to share their data for a better consumer finance experience, Mr. Beryl said. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest has made individual loans of more than $250,000. Traditional credit scoring, Mr. Beryl said, tends to punish high student debt loads. But such Earnest borrowers, he said, are in fields like brain surgery and dental surgery, where education is lengthy and costly. These are people with great jobs, great educations and great earning potential, he added. Earnest borrowers average a bit over 30-years-old  young people with slender credit histories and thus charged higher rates by traditional banks. Mr. Beryl said Earnest has had no delinquency problems on its student refinancing loans. And Mr. Beryl, 34, is one of those prompt-paying customers. Having attended Princeton, Harvard Business School and Harvards Kennedy School of Government, he had $100,000 in student loans at the start of the year. He has paid down some, but still holds student loan debt, he said.\n"

      "Chip-Only, or Chip-And-Pin Credit Cards Give Retailers Another Grievance Against Banks:The employee perched on a stepstool by the checkout at Trader Joes in Union Square in Manhattan is like an air traffic controller: Register 6 for one customer. Register 9 for the next. The routine helps move traffic quickly through the store, where the lines can often snake around the aisles of whole grain cereal, mixed nuts and Fair Trade coffee. Trader Joes, like many retailers around the country, recently upgraded its payment terminals around the Oct. 1 deadline to accept debit and credit cards with a new security chip. The timing, retailers say, could not be worse. The new terminals are often slower, meaning that the long lines during the busy year-end holiday season will grow longer. The new chip cards are also at the center of a growing dispute that has pitted two of Americas most prominent industries  banking and retailing  against each other, and pulled in attorneys general and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the process. But the debate involves more than whether consumers will be adequately protected during a season that has been rife with security breaches: The battle could affect the long-simmering war over the billions of dollars in interchange fees that merchants pay to process credit and debit transactions. That is the crux of the matter, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a payments industry publication. The real savings is not about fraud, the real savings is about interchange. Last year, merchants paid about $61 billion in interchange fees, Mr. Robertson said, compared with about $30 billion in fraud losses. The fight involves new payment cards, issued over the last year, that come with a small square security chip that can help make in-person transactions more secure. Retailers complain that they have spent billions of dollars upgrading their payment terminals to accommodate a system that cuts down only on the fraud shouldered by banks, not merchants. Chip and PIN, long the standard in Europe, would help retailers verify not just the card, but the person using it. Writing to their colleagues in October, two attorneys general sounded a warning bell: The new security chip would not go far enough to make transactions safer. Credit cards needed a PIN, too. If we continue to settle for weaker standards here, we will continue to pay the price, wrote Sam Olens, the Republican Georgia attorney general, and George Jepsen, his Democratic counterpart in Connecticut. They urged top prosecutors in other states to sign a separate letter to Visa, MasterCard, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and other institutions, pushing them to adopt the chip-and-PIN technology. Banking groups were swift to issue their own statement, saying that merchants had been spreading an outdated narrative. In November, a spokesman for Mr. Olens confirmed that he had taken his name off the letter.\n",
      "For Indian tech startups, 'Winter is here and why this is a great time to invest':The horizontal e-commerce Unicorns in India  Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, and adding ShopClues and even a more diversified Paytm  are in a dogfight with no end in sight. It doesnt help that Amazon keeps on growing from strength to strength and getting more aggressive. The online classified players have even bigger issues. Unlike the e-commerce Unicorns, Quikr, OLX, the real estate and car classified firms and other listing-related ones like Zomato have yet to see a serious revenue jump that matches their astounding valuation surge. They all have a serious dogfight coming with no one being particularly dominant in their segment (well Zomato is, but is revenue growth justifying valuation). Ola and Uber Ditto, serious dogfight with no end in sight. Ad-tech Tough for InMobi and Pubmatic to claim resilience and justify high valuations when Facebook and Google want to eat it all. Payments Paytm has an extraordinary franchise but is it too distracted with other possibilities Probably the only secure privately-held Unicorn in India is MuSigma  no surprise there as it has real profits and real cash generation. All the rest of the Unicorns are work in process. For early-stage startups, good news and very bad news. The good news is that several Series A funds have lots of dry powder  Accel, Kalaari, Matrix, Nexus, SAIF, Sequoia, etc. will all continue to invest and there will be some fantastic opportunities as the extraordinary customer adoption, benefits of a hyper-connected world and improvements in broadband infrastructure will continue. This is a great time to invest, much like 2008-2011 when many Unicorns of today were created. Many investors have seen such down cycles before and they will not retreat. We also plan to continue investing at our regular rate of one to two deals per quarter. However, Series A investors have to be prepared to fund fewer deals and fund the winners more as Series B/C will not be easy to come by as the hedgies boosting up this market and valuations are more or less gone. Indian startups are not a good trade anymore! The really bad news is that funding will be available to only a small number of players, as investors get overly conservative. There will be mass closures or scale downs and heavy bleeding for many angel, seed and Series A investors. Capital will vanish for not only the vague and fluffy ideas but even for some good ones as they will get washed away with the tide and sink.\n",
      "Cisco quarterly forecast misses expectations, shares down 5%:Network equipment maker Cisco forecast adjusted profit and revenue growth for the second quarter below analysts' estimates, citing a slowdown in order growth and weakness in its enterprise business outside the United States. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, fell 5 percent to $26.41 in extended trading on Thursday. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $12.68 billion, while analysts were expecting $12.65 billion. Net income rose 33 percent to $2.43 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter ended October 24. Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson attributed Cisco's disappointing forecast to its exposure to emerging markets. \"It has a much higher percentage exposure to those emerging markets than most companies,\" Henderson said. Cisco is beefing up its enterprise and wireless security businesses to counter lower spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, and nimbler rivals who are quickly grabbing market share through their software-focused networking products. In August, Cisco teamed up with Apple to improve the performance of iPads and iPhones on its network.\n",
      "After Square and DropBox, possible decline in Snapchat valuation signals trouble for unicorns:The worth of hot technology start-ups seemed for years to go in only one direction: straight up. Now there are signs of growing unease over the dizzying valuations of some of the most richly priced private companies. The latest sign has emerged with one such favorite, Snapchat, being discounted 25 percent by one of its more recent investors, Fidelity, the mutual fund giant. Another start-up, Dropbox, the widely used file storage service, was devalued by the giant asset manager BlackRock this year. The funds markdowns may tap the brakes on a fast-growing market. Investors, in the hopes of getting a piece of the next Facebook or Google, have been pouring billions of dollars into young private companies. Yet the public stock market has cooled for new technology companies: witness the current effort by Square, a mobile payments company, to go public at a valuation lower than what its last private investment gave it. The moves by Fidelity and BlackRock reflect how mutual funds can create challenges for technologys favored start-ups, just as they helped inflate valuations in the first place. Over the last few years, mutual funds fought to buy pieces of appealing venture-backed companies like Snapchat and Dropbox. The idea was that public investors wanted to own these start-ups because their value was growing faster than that of many publicly traded companies. By owning the private shares, the large mutual funds would also get to know the start-ups and be well positioned to buy their shares when they went public. As mutual fund and venture capital investors jockeyed with hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds to invest, their abundant capital pushed prices for private shares into the stratosphere. Snapchat, for example, is valued at more than $16 billion and Dropbox at around $10 billion. The biggest prize of them all, Uber, is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at $60 billion to $70 billion. Ubers success with that round would be a further test of investors appetite. The competition among investors also helped create a herd of dozens of unicorns, a term for private companies valued above $1 billion, coined when such a phenomenon was still considered rare. Yet unlike venture capital firms, mutual funds are legally obligated to value each of their portfolio holdings every day, including hard-to-value assets like shares in private companies, and they must report these values at least every half year. A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, one of the largest mutual fund associations, said that the process was a good faith determination of what an owner could get in a sale of the asset.\n",
      "With a Mobile Website Like an App, Flipkart Takes a Swipe at Apple:Indias e-commerce start-up Flipkart has worked with Google to make a new mobile website that could eliminate the need for apps, in a move that takes a swipe at Apples grip on the mobile experience.On Monday, Flipkart unveiled the website, which it created with the Google team that focuses on the mobile web browser Chrome. The two made a site that supports push notifications, the ability to search for and read information while offline, location-based data and access to hardware features like a smartphones camera. While such features have long been available in apps that people download to their phones, they typically have not been prevalent on mobile websites.Flipkart plans to show other companies what it took to build the website  including the hurdles it had to overcome and the weaknesses it found  at Googles Chrome Developers Conference this month. Googles parent company is Alphabet.\n",
      "Square Takes an IPO Bullet for All of the Overpriced Unicorns:Square announced plans on Friday morning to price its IPO at $11 to $13 a share, meaning an IPO in that range would value the company at much less than the valuation it secured in its last round of private financing.If the company prices at $13, Square would carry a value of about $4.2 billion based on the approximately 323 million shares it says will be outstanding. Square, Jack Dorseys payments company, was valued by private investors at about $6 billion in its last round of private financing, according to insiders.To be sure, Squares bankers could increase the price range before the IPO if they get feedback from investors that demand is higher than expected. But the range would have to jump a fair bit to even match what Square thought it was worth in its last round of funding.\n",
      "Why Health Care Start-Ups Like Theranos Need Investing Expertise:The Silicon Valley start-ups that often grab headlines are typically in the Internet and consumer technology world. But theres another part of start-up land that is also highly active: health-related technology, which includes biotech, health care services and medical devices.Venture capitalists have been pouring money into health-related start-ups, with funding jumping 34 percent to $9.4 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Whats often left unsaid about these companies is that they behave very differently from the typical consumer start-up or business software company.The health-related start-up sector has produced fewer unicorns, which are the private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations, largely because it takes a long time to develop new medical tests, drugs or insurance systems. Regulators often weigh in. Even if an idea behind a start-up is truly great, its bound to fail if the science doesnt work out, if the regulators dont like what they see, or if insurers and the government wont pay for the product.\n"

      "Facebook Revenue Surges 41%, as Ads and Users Keep Growing:It takes money, the adage goes, to make money. And Facebook is spending a lot of dollars to do just that.The social media giant on Wednesday posted another quarter of robust revenue growth  up 41 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $4.5 billion  fueled by its mobile advertising business and an increase in daily users. Net profit rose to $896 million, up 11 percent from a year ago.The revenue and profit increases came alongside a surge in spending. Facebooks expenses totaled more than $3 billion in the third quarter, a 62 percent leap from a year earlier, meaning that spending growth is outpacing sales growth. The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., emphasized that it had no intention of slowing that down as it invested heavily in hiring, marketing, new technologies and other initiatives.\n",

      "Snapchats new Terms of Service freaked people out because no one reads them:Snapchat updated its Terms of Service last week, and the Internet freaked out a little bit. Some users interpreted changes to mean the company could now hang on to users' private messages, broadcast them publicly and sell them to third parties. The pushback grew so loud that Snapchat took to its blog Sunday to explain itself, saying that private Snaps and Chats are still automatically deleted from its servers once viewed or expired. But, Snapchat said, its new Terms of Service granted the company \"broad license\" to user content. The company said those clauses are meant to apply to images and videos users share publicly for its \"Live Stories\" feature, which may be syndicated across other platforms. The new policy was also expanded to account for its Replay feature, which charges users who want to rewatch videos more than once, the blog post said.\n",

      "Alphabet Edges Toward Settling the Android or Chrome Question:For years, Google, now known as Alphabet, has supported two operating systems on two very different tracks: Android and Chrome. But now the company is nodding in the direction of Android. Google is working toward allowing its low-cost Chromebook computing devices to work on the popular Android operating system. The work will take place over the next year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Google is not indicating it plans to stop development of Chrome OS, but making Android work on Chromebooks opens the door to one of the few products that Chrome OS, the lesser-known operating system, had to itself. Chrome OS should not be confused with Googles popular Chrome web browser. The first Android operating system for mobile devices was introduced about seven years ago as a direct competitor to Apples iOS mobile operating system. Since then, it has become the most widely used operating system in the world. Its development was led by an executive named Andy Rubin, who went on to lead much of the companys robotics efforts before leaving Google last year. Google introduced Chrome OS about a year later, surprising some who wondered why the company needed two operating systems. Interestingly, its early development was led by Sundar Pichai, who is now the chief executive of the part of Alphabet that is still called Google. Chrome OS has gained a following in academia but very few other places. According to IDC, a market research firm, about 3.9 million Chromebooks were shipped to the American education sector last year. If Google should drop the Chrome OS, it will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft. The latest version of Microsofts flagship Windows operating system is meant to run on both PCs and mobile devices. Apple still supports separate operating systems for mobile devices and PCs.\n",
      "Flipboard's Fanfare Fades as Executives Exit, Sale Talks Stall:Flipboard Inc. debuted in 2010 with the kind of fanfare any startup would envy. The news-reading app piggybacked perfectly on the debut of Apples iPad tablet and Steve Jobss promise of a new era for digital media. Critics loved Flipboards magazine-like layout, created by one of the first software designers of the iPhone, and investors poured money into the company. Almost five years later, Flipboard is struggling to live up to the praise. Several senior executives have departed, including co-founder Evan Doll, and talks to sell the company havent reached the finish line, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not be named discussing private matters. Flipboards woes are indicative of a larger malaise gripping startups across the technology landscape as questions emerge about the sustainability of the tech-investment boom. Flipboard is performing well enough -- and, after raising more capital earlier this year, is at no risk of going out of business -- but is no longer a breakaway hit. People are finding media through their Facebook or Twitter feeds, limiting the need for a stand-alone application like Flipboard. Meanwhile, advertising rates -- the companys main revenue stream-- have been in decline. While Flipboards reading app was a showpiece for the iPad five years ago, the company is now working to adjust to a changing digital-news market and live up to its $800 million valuation. Other companies facing similar questions about whether they can make good on early investor expectations -- and lofty private-market valuations -- include online storage service Dropbox Inc., note-taking company Evernote Corp., music-streaming service Deezer SA and blood-testing company Theranos Inc., said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of CB Insights, a firm that tracks startup investing. The companies face a challenge in that they could be too expensive for another company to buy, yet may not have the business fundamentals to justify their valuations to public investors through an initial public offering, he said.\n",
      "Apple Profit Is Up 31%, Revenue Up 22% as iPhones Sell Briskly, but Its Forecast Is Muted:Apple on Tuesday turned in another quarter of enviable revenue and profit growth, fueled by sales of the iPhone. But the results raised a perennial question for the worlds most valuable company: How can it keep its growth streak alive The issue was stoked by Apples muted forecast for its all-important holiday quarter, as well as the unwillingness of Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, to go into detail in an earnings conference call about how Apple plans to rev up sales next year. Over all, Apple posted a profit of $11.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $51.5 billion, up 22 percent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates. Yet while the performance was bolstered by sales of the iPhone  Apple said that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 39 million in the same period last year  the company was more cautious about sales for the key holiday sales period. Apple projected revenue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year quarter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell below Wall Street estimates and would amount to anemic growth of less than 4 percent from a year ago. The last time Apples quarterly sales fell below 4 percent was in mid-2013.New Products:Apple is going into 2016 with a full slate of refreshed products. In late September, the company introduced its newest iPhone models, the 6s and 6s Plus. It also announced a larger iPad, the iPad Pro, and will begin shipping a new Apple TV this week.IPad Struggles:While the iPhone continues to grow, the iPad has been facing declines. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPad sales dropped 20 percent from a year ago, making it the seventh consecutive quarter that sales of the tablet have slipped. The company is increasingly positioning the iPad as a business device.Apple Watch:The company did not break out sales of the Apple Watch, which debuted in April. But the category called other products  which includes the watch  posted $3 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the previous quarter, which was the first quarter that included sales of the device. Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the numbers for the other category were in line with his expectations, and implied somewhere between 3.5 million and four million watches were sold over the quarter.China:One of Apples fastest-growing markets  China  continued to grow. Sales in the region that Apple calls Greater China jumped 99 percent in the quarter to $12.5 billion. The region remained the companys second-largest market after the Americas, accounting for 24 percent of sales in the quarter, compared with 13.7 percent a year ago. Investors have been scrutinizing the China business given that the country has been cutting interest rates to shore up a slowing economy.Apple Pay:Apple said it has partnered with American Express to bring its Apple Pay mobile payments service to global markets. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the credit card company will bring the service to customers in Australia and Canada, then expand to Spain, Hong Kong and Singapore in 2016.\n"

      "Reuters Exclusive: Wal-Mart seeks to test drones for home delivery, pickup:Wal-Mart applied Monday to U.S. regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories, a sign it plans to go head-to-head with Amazon in using drones to fill and deliver online orders. The world's largest retailer by revenue has for several months been conducting indoor tests of small unmanned aircraft systems  the term regulators use for drones - and is now seeking for the first time to test the machines outdoors. It plans to use drones manufactured by China's SZ DJI. In addition to having drones take inventory of trailers outside its warehouses and perform other tasks aimed at making its distribution system more efficient, Wal-Mart is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to research drone use in \"deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes,\" according to a copy of the application reviewed by Reuters. The move comes as Amazon.com, Google and other companies test drones in the expectation that the FAA will soon establish rules for their widespread commercial use. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said in June that the agency expected to finalize regulations within the next 12 months, faster than previously planned. Commercial drone use is currently illegal, though companies can apply for exemptions.\n",

       "[\"SoftBank's $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar:In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources,cloutand name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, Indias largestdigital-paymentsstartup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish givenPaytm'sdominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo,Alibabaand Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted.\",\n",
       " 'Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking CatEven by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. Its hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million.Jinkewont say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. Theres been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor.According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isnt stopping to ask questions. A vegan, hes using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation. Its not easy, he says, to find buyers for a $1 billion company. The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations theyd never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earningsmore than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once its part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world.',\n",

At the American Planning Associations annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldnt reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.',\n",
       " 'Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says:Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Ubers development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber andWaymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Googles parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies,automakersand start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, WaymoL.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files fromWaymoimmediately before leaving his employment there.He added, Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession ofWaymosconfidential files.Judge Alsup also ruled thatWaymosignificantly overreached when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not secret, since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees, Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowskis hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files toWaymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowskis employment at Uber.Despite the judges ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.',\n",

Mr. Wood, who lives in San Francisco with his fiance and their infant, said his channel had brought in at least $6,000 a month in revenue last year  which helped pay for travel to site locations, the production of his videos and his other day-to-day bills.

       " 'Virtual Reality Companies Navigate The Trough of Disillusionment:Twelve months ago the Virtual Reality World Congress in Bristol, England, was a sell-out show, with over 750 attendees gawping over the latest VR hardware and production techniques. This year\\'s event, which took place last week,attracted even moreparticipants -- more than 1,200 over three days -- but the mood felt decidedly less upbeat. Virtual reality, it seems, has been mugged by reality. Sales of VR hardware have fallen 40 percent behind forecasts, CCS Insight, a technology research group, said in a February report. And the VR hardware that is selling has mostly been relatively inexpensive goggles that allow people to experience VR through their smartphones, such as Samsung\\'s Gear VR and Google\\'s Daydream, not higher-end, dedicated headsets such as those made by Sony Corp, Facebook Inc.\\'s Oculus and HTC Corp. Many working in VR have run up against the hard economic reality of trying to produce content for a technology that remains, at least for the moment, fairly niche. As disappointment is setting in for virtual reality, expectations are building around its less glamorous cousin, augmented reality, which is also sometimes called mixed reality because it places digitally-rendered elements in the real observed environment. In 2016, Pokemon Go, which is an augmented reality game played on smartphones, became a worldwide phenomenon. Microsoft launched its high-end AR headset, HoloLens, which has found customers mostly among industrial and business users -- such as aeronautical engineers and architects. Snap Inc.\\'s AR photo filters are one of the most popular features of its messaging service and Facebook has announced a big push into the field with its own AR camera filters. Many now expect Apple Inc. to introduce an augmented reality product in the next year, which might help AR to leapfrog VR to achieve mass adoption. Technology company ABI Research says that virtual reality currently generates about 50 percent more revenue than augmented reality but that it relies heavily on hardware sales. Augmented reality, by contrast, relies more on software and in many cases can be experienced by users with their existing smartphones. ABI forecasts that AR revenues will surpass VR sales by 2019. Virtual reality true believers, like Taylor, are dismissive of the idea that AR might outrun VR as a blockbuster consumer technology. Augmented reality requires too much training for the average consumer to learn how to integrate the digital images into the real world, Taylor said. \"Mixing the virtual world and the real world is less natural,\" he said. Simply popping on a headset and diving into a completely virtual environment is, somewhat counter-intuitively, easier, he said. ABI Research still forecasts that virtual reality device shipments will reach 110 million units by 2021 -- huge growth considering only about 6.3 million such devices were shipped last year, according to tech research company Super Data.',\n",

To get the merger done, Son is willing to cut Snapdeals valuation 85 percent to $1 billion, said the people, asking not to be named because the talk is private. The combination of Indias two leading e-commerce players is being called an arranged marriage, said the people, with Son playing the role of matchmaker.

Flipkart is already raising cash for the battle. The Bangalore-based company said Monday it had raised $1.4 billion from Tencent Holdings Ltd., Microsoft Corp. and EBay Inc. in what it said was the largest internet investment in India. That would give Flipkart more firepower to battle Amazon in one of the worlds fastest growing online retail markets.

The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect.As smartphones became everyday tools, Dysons robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications  with a heat map of where it had cleaned  to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year.At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for, Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dysons rural headquarters near the border with Wales. But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow. Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades  and tens of millions of dollars  building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop.But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the nonglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers  and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware.Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, the smartwatch maker Fitbit and the camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson inrarefiedcompany alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets.',\n",

Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front and may have missed an opportunity to capitalize on competitors' missteps.While Google doesn't break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation.To put that in perspective, Google's market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one percent worldwide  as compared to Samsung's 18 percent and Apple's 18.2 percent  said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation.On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel's Google branding, Samsung's Note 7 problems, and criticism of Apple's latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is a solid phone thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant.The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google forfullprice of $649  and take it to another carrier if they want  that's not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about.Compounding the availability issue, Moore said, is that stores are having trouble keeping the phones in stock. That's a good sign for Google in terms of demand, but also a bad sign for the company in terms of being able to capitalize on that demand, he said.\",\n",
       " 'How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide:Uber has for years engaged in a worldwide program to deceive the authorities in markets where its low-cost ride-hailing service was resisted by law enforcement or, in some instances, had been banned.The program, involving a tool calledGreyball, uses data collected from the Uber app and other techniques to identify and circumvent officials who were trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service. Uber used these methods to evade the authorities in cities like Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, and in countries like Australia,Chinaand South Korea.Greyballwas part of a program called VTOS, short for violation of terms of service, which Uber created to root out people it thought were using or targeting its service improperly. The program, includingGreyball, began as early as 2014 and remains in use, predominantly outside the United States.Greyballwas approved by Ubers legal team.Greyballand the VTOS program were described to The New York Times by four current and former Uber employees, who also provided documents. The four spoke on the condition of anonymity because the tools and their use are confidential and because of fear of retaliation by Uber. One technique involved drawing a digital perimeter, or geofence, around the government offices on a digital map of a city that Uber was monitoring. The company watched which people were frequently opening and closing the app  a process known internally as eyeballing  near such locations as evidence that the users might be associated with city agencies.Other techniques included looking at a users credit card information and determining whether the card was tied directly to an institution like a police credit union.Enforcement officials involved in large-scale sting operations meant to catch Uber drivers would sometimes buy dozens ofcellphonesto create different accounts. To circumvent that tactic, Uber employees would go to local electronics stores to look up device numbers of the cheapest mobile phones for sale, which were often the ones bought by city officials working with budgets that were not large.In all, there were at least a dozen or so signifiers in the VTOS program that Uber employees could use to assess whether users were regular new riders or probably city officials.If such clues did not confirm a users identity, Uber employees would search social media profiles and other information available online. If users were identified as being linked to law enforcement, Uber Greyballed them by tagging them with a small piece of code that read Greyball followed by a string of numbers.When someone tagged this way called a car, Uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see, or show that no cars were available. Occasionally, if a driver accidentally picked up someone tagged as an officer, Uber called the driver with instructions to end the ride.',\n",

According to multiple sources and internal notes read to me, after discussing the claims of an alleged encounter between Singhal and a female employee first with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015, he denied those claims at the time. He also apparently stated a number of times that there were two sides to every story.But, after the Christmas holidays, he then decided to resign himself after a 15-year career there.Sources said that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned.',\n",

Attached to the email were drawings of Ottos lidar circuit board.It looked just likeWaymosdesign, the company alleged in the suit filed today, the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.The Replicated Board reflectsWaymoshighly confidential proprietary LiDAR technology andWaymotrade secrets, the complaint reads. Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many otherWaymotrade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered byWaymopatents.To then verify its suspicions,Waymofileda public recordsrequest to the Nevada Governors Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles in February for Ottos communications with the departments.In that correspondence, Otto indicated that the company was using custom lidar that it built in-house.Waymocites this as evidence that Uber and Otto are using a circuit board that bears a striking resemblance toWaymos.

Revenue from advertising fell from a year ago and a 4.0 percent year-on-year rise in users to 319 million fell short of Wall Street forecasts as well. Total revenue grew 1.0 percent to $717.2 million. The election of prolific tweeter Donald Trump as U.S. president failed to produce a \"Trump Bump\" in Twitter\\'s results, and Twitter declined to give guidance on future revenue with Chief Executive Jack Dorsey asking for patience. The microblogging service has struggled to find a formula that will attract a new crop of users or advertisers even as rivals have ridden a wave of rising investment in internet advertising. The lack of revenue growth has raised questions about Dorsey\\'s leadership and whether the company would be bought by a bigger media firm. Financial markets speculated about a sale of Twitter last year, but no concrete bids were forthcoming. Dorsey also faced concerns about his dual role as the chief executive of both Twitter and Square Inc. \"Running two companies is not the best idea,\" Steve Ballmer, a Twitter investor and a former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) chief executive, told CNBC.

That means that if a business is trying to show off their products, users will have yet another way to jump to similar products theyre showing on Pinterest. All this is a result of the companys major investments in image search. Pinterest has largely built a name for itself because of its strong image search capabilities, and that thus far has been its selling point for advertisers. While companies like Google can capture the intent of a user directly searching for a product, Pinterest also taps into moments where potential customers are just meandering around and might stumble onto a product they may later buy.

In its filing for an initial share sale, the maker of the Snapchat mobile app emphasized that it measures itself by daily active users -- a metric that Twitter doesn\\'t disclose. Snap explained that its users tell stories chronologically, unlike the Twitter timeline, which displays most recent posts first. The younger company also said it plans to focus on developed markets, instead of racing to find users all over the world. Snap calls itself a \"camera company,\" rather than focusing on its messaging app or media content.No matter the positioning, Snap\\'s numbers raise the same questions Twitter\\'s did. User growth is slowing and losses are mounting, but revenue gains are a bright spot. That\\'s how Twitter\\'s financial details looked when it filed to go public in 2013, and the investor concern has never subsided, even after a spate of executive departures made way for new management and initiatives to jump-start user growth. Twitter\\'s revenue started to slow when advertisers realized that with stagnant user growth, there wasn\\'t a reason to spend more. Snap is also trying to avoid one of Twitter\\'s IPO mistakes. Twitter compared itself in strategy to social media giant Facebook, but ultimately it paled in contrast to its rapidly growingrival,and has gotten punished by investors since then. Instead, Snap frames itself as a portfolio company, the owner of the Snapchat app, the Spectacles wearable video camera, andmanymore things to come.

GoPro Inc., which makes small wearableaction-videocameras beloved by extreme sports aficionados and outdoor enthusiasts, had its own highly anticipated public offering in 2014. It had a premise similar to Snap: capturing memories in the moment they happen, with the raw perspective of the user. As demand for its devices subsided, GoPro aimed instead to be a media company, seeking to generate more revenue from content that users created and selling advertising.

However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015.Snap\\'s biggest losses stem from \"hosting fees\" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services.Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost ofthese serviceis high. Still, the proportion of the company\\'s costs to its revenue has been declining.

The idea ofnetworking in generalhas evolved over time as new kinds of devices find their way onto the Internet, and now it would seem Cisco is continuing that move beyond its usual competency.AppDynamics may have even been testing the waters of the IPO market to set a value for itself for negotiations with larger companies for a potential acquisition. Its not entirely uncommon that companies are working to not only drop a filing and intent to go public while having acquisition talks behind the scenes. AppDynamics previously raised $314.5million,and was most recently valued at $1.9 billion. So the exit looks like its about a 2x jump from its previous valuation  which is not all that bad of an outcome in the scope of larger enterprise deals. The deal will be in cash and assumed equity awards, Cisco said in a statement.',\n",
       " 'Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Signals Problems at Korea Inc.With the Note 7, Samsung pushed its business model, as well as its technology, to the limit, according to Samsung officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the Note 7 investigation was being completed. Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apples iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security.But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws.UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred.Samsungs insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say. In place of big new ideas, Samsung focused on maxing out the capability of components like the battery. That philosophy, which worked to keep Samsung on the heels of the likes of Apple, simply is not as effective as Samsung tries to push ahead, they argue. But for many of the companys critics, the most interesting part of the presentation was what Samsung did not say: How could such a technologically advanced titan  a symbol of South Koreas considerable industrial might  allow the problems tohappento begin with The answer to that questiongets todeep shortfalls that former employees, suppliers and others who watch the company say may have contributed to the incident. Samsung, like South Korea as a whole, fosters a top-down, hidebound culture that stifles innovation and buries festering problems, they say. For those critics, these problems have come to light through another front: politics. Samsung has been caught up in a scandal surrounding the countrys president, which they say illustrates a hierarchical culture that tends to micromanage away creativity and insulate family-run business empires from accountability and competition.',\n",

While virtual reality hasnt quite reached the mainstream, it has succeeded in landing Mr. Zuckerberg in the middle of a courtroom fight over who owns a crucial piece of the technology.The dispute started two and a half years ago when a videogame publisher, ZeniMax Media, sued Oculus VR, a start-up behind a virtual reality headset, only months after Facebook announced that it would acquire Oculus for $2 billion. ZeniMax accused Oculus of stealing important elements of the technology that went into the creation of the headset, eventually including Facebook among the parties it was suing.While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by making it to a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg made a rare appearance in court and was questioned about the Oculus deal. While pushing back on accusations that Oculus took technology that it didnt own, Mr. Zuckerberg said it was his first time testifying in a courtroom.We are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology, said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit while testifying, instead of his regular uniform of a hoodie and jeans. The idea that Oculus products are based on someone elses technology is just wrong. Facebook could face hefty damages if it loses the suit, which could make its payoff from virtual reality recede further into the future. While virtual reality has excited people in the technology industry, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them.The core of ZeniMaxs case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the early days of Oculus, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.',\n",

       " 'Two reasons the red Solo Cup is a marvel of modern engineering:The red Solo Cup is an elegant piece of technology. It\\'s easy to forget when you find them strewn across the room, half-filled with leftover beer or crushed underfoot from parties the night before. But what many take for granted as simply a cheap, disposable beverage holder is the result of careful, beautiful engineering by people such as Robert Hulseman. While regular users may admire the Solo Cup\\'s lightness and balance, particularly when filled to the brim with libation, some of the most underappreciated aspects of the cup can be traced to a simple design aimed at solving a rather sticky problem. Before the invention of the SoloCupas we know it, it was often difficult to remove one disposable cup from a whole stack because of the way they sometimes clung together, and designs aimed at eliminating the issue resulted in production irregularities that drove up costs and increased the likelihood of cup breakage. For a thing whose whole job is to hold other things, this outcome simply would not do. Enter the plastic Solo Cup, which won a patent in 1976. Described as \"an expendable thin walled cup for liquids and the like,\" the Solo Cup offered two key innovations that, according to the company, helped solve the sticking associated with large stacks of cups as well as the hard problem of cleanly removing the plastic cups from the production molds.One of the Solo Cup\\'s distinguishing features, according to the patent, was the curved lip of each cup (see 10a in Fig.3). When several cups were stacked together, the lips would \"engage\"  to use the company\\'s language  and rest upon each other, keeping one cup from sinking too tightly into the next. But, Solo Cup Co. observed, this helped create another problem. When cups like these were subjected to crushing forces from various angles, the bottoms could warp in ways that actually made it harder to separate the cups. So the bottoms had to be reinforced (see Fig. 4, Fig. 6 and 26-28 in Fig. 3). This is how the plastic Solo Cup gained indentations or divots in the base that made the bottoms more rigid and allowed for more air flow between each stacked cup, which allegedly had the side benefit of helping the cups come apart.',\n",

       " 'WTF is a liquidation preference Lets walk through the basics.Broadly, a liquidation preference determines who gets what when a company is liquidated. This can mean when a company is merged, when its sold, when theres a change of control of the company or when theres a wind-down.In all of these scenarios, a companys liquidator looks at the companys secured and unsecured loan agreements, along with who owns preferred versus common stock. (Preferred shares are what VCs typically buy to ensure that theyre repaid ahead of holders of common shares.) Everyone on the companys cap table is ranked after that, and the liquidator distributes the proceeds of a sale accordingly. Consider the wind-down scenario. Lets say a company raised both venture capital and venture debt  a loan. Say that as time went on, it began falling behind on its debt payments, and that its VCs decided it was a losing proposition to continue funding the company. If there was any capital remaining  say the company hadnt burned through every last bit of its funding, or say some money was made from a sell-off of its remaining assets, like its intellectual property  its investors would be paid before anyone at the company saw a nickel.When the outcome is much better, the same thing basically happens  though who gets how much and when grows more complicated with every new round of funding a company raises. The reason: When investors make a liquidation preference a condition for investing in a startup, they do it in order to claim their part of the profits first. But later-stage investors can demand liquidation preferences that ensure they get paid before earlier investors, too. Its kind of like a layer cake. They can also demand that they get paid back more than the standard of one times their money back.Why would startups agree to these seemingly onerous terms Well, sometimes, they dont have any choice. They take the terms, or they go out of business. Sometimes, startups wanting unicorn status will agree to the terms for a richer valuation, thinking it will attract press, customers and employees. Whether its worth the gamble takes time to play out. But certainly, things can get ugly when these same companies get sold rather than go public (a process that converts everyones shares to common shares). Its uglier still when they sell for less than expected, the investors take their cut, and theres little to nothing left for founders and employees.Not every deal involves liquidation preferences. You dont typically see them in early-stage deals. You dont seem them in deals where a company has been created by a founder whom VCs trip over themselves to fund. But they do start to appear as a company matures. (For some context, in recent quarters, senior liquidation preferences have been showing up in between 25 and 35 percent of deals, according to the law firm Fenwick & West, which studies these things.)',\n",

Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers  all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry. Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning  the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time  mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years. The challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesnt have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares  at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesnt have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain. It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems  akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google. Google has struggled to find a way to come to market, said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. Weve come to the point where Google needs a return.',\n",

But youll get used to it.The absence of a jack is far from the worst shortcoming in Apples latest product launch.

And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apples best designs, what was iconic about the companys phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.This is a subjective assessment, and its one that Apple rebuts.Yet there are signs that my critique of Apples designs are shared by others. Industrial designers and tech critics used to swoon over Apples latest hardware; nowadays you witness less swooning and more bemusement.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics.

Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.',\n",

Once just the realm of startups, the sector has attracted heavy hitters in Chinas online industry, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s finance affiliate and JD.com Inc., which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the lending model. In a nation with 37 million college students, the market is expected to reach $15 billion, according to the Beijing-based market research firm Analysys. The apps sell everything from cameras to concert tickets sourced from third-parties, charging students annualized interest rates typically above 10 percent. The loans are then packaged and sold to wealthy individuals, who find the expected return of as much as 10 percent much more attractive than the central banks benchmark savings rate of 1.75 percent.',\n",

       " \"Most Americans streamed the Olympics from PCs, not mobile devices.Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, accounted for almost 20 percent of the evening's Olympics stream. An additional 17 percent went to set-top boxes, such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Of these, Roku boxes were the overwhelming favorite among Olympics viewers, eating up a 10 percent share. In the end, however, PCs took the prize, accounting for more than 60 percent of consumption. Why is this so interesting Well, much of the narrative surrounding entertainment and technology these days has to do with mobile devices becoming a more dominant platform. Sandvine's data show that iPhones, Android devices and iPads account for almost one-third of general Internet consumption, much higher than what we see from the chart above.Analysts say this discrepancy highlights the particular way in which Americans could access their Olympics coverage online. To watch the Internet live stream, viewers needed to log in through their cable subscription. The downside to this meant being chained to a cable provider, but the upside was that once you authenticated you could watch from any device  mobile or otherwise. Although much of our media consumption is increasingly shifting toward mobile devices, live-stream events such as the Olympics may be one area where PCs could remain dominant for some time.\",\n",

And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces  but has found that its options are limited.The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Lyfts discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing companys largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive.

Despite GMV growth remaining low compared to previous years, rising 24 percent to 837 billion yuan, Alibaba is squeezing more money out of its e-commerce business, chiefly from advertising. That translated to quarterly revenues of 32.15 billion yuan ($4.84 billion), a 59 percent leap from the previous year and the highest growth rate since late 2013.

       " 'Verizon to Pay $4.8 Billion for Yahoos Core Business:the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterdays great idea, and on Sunday, Yahoo reached the end of the line as an independent company.The board of the Silicon Valley company agreed to sell Yahoos core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.Thats a pittance compared with Yahoos peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000. Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.But Yahoo, despite constant management turmoil, kept growing. Started as a directory of websites, the company was soon doing much more, offering searches, email, shopping and news. Those services, which were free to consumers, were supported by advertising displayed on its various pages.For a long time, the model worked. It seemed like every company in America  and across much of the world  wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured in to Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival was a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancy, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.Verizon, one of the nations biggest telecommunications companies, plans to combine Yahoos operations with AOL, a longtime Yahoo competitor acquired by Verizon last year. The idea is to use Yahoos vast array of content and its advertising technology to offer more robust services to Verizon customers and advertisers.',\n",

In fact, at the current rate, deal activity will just barely top 2013s numbers.\"Many of the high-profile tech [initial public offerings] from 2015 continue to trade well below their initial offering price, putting pressure on private company valuations,\" said Brian Hughes of KPMG. \"This, combined with economic concerns in China and Europe, has continued to put a damper on VC investment.\"\"It\\'s a challenging time for VC investors,\" he concluded.The reason funding moved higher while deal activity dropped is that some larger startups such as those of Snapchat Inc., Didi Chuxing, and Uber Technologies Inc. all saw huge rounds, accounting for much of the funding. In fact, in North America, Uber and Snapchat accounted for more than $4.5 billion of the $17.1 billion in total investment.And while there might have been more billion dollar companies minted in the second quarter than in the first, there were yet again more \"down events\"companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuationthan there were unicorns created. According to the report, seven startups reached the unicorn club in the past four months, but CB Insights downround tracker shows that 17 failed to live up to expectations and experienced down events over that time. Unicorn creation saw its most recent peak in the third quarter of last year, when 25 were birthed.',\n",

That\\'s because the key to Dollar Shave Club\\'s appeal is not so much its online prowess but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years. Dollar Shave Club upended the industry\\'s traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). The day Dollar Shave Club started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, \"so gentle a toddler could use it.\" The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. The video has been viewed about 23 million times. The company reached $150 million-plus in sales in 2015, Unilever said in a press release announcing the deal. That despite the fact that the blades lack many of Gillette\\'s high-tech enhancements. Few other e-commerce startups can claim to have built a brand so quickly. Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, mostly offline, but they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel.',\n",
       " 'Microsoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business:On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.Microsofts chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable  a trade-off for slimmer margins.After Microsofts misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.Without the deferral, Microsofts revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion.The companys shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.',\n",

Also disconcerting was that Netflix added far fewer subscribers over all during the period than expected, which the company blamed on news media coverage of its plans for price increases.Netflix added just 1.7 million new streaming members in the three months that ended June 30, about half the 3.3 million net additions from the same period the previous year. That anemic growth  for both United States and international subscribers  came in well below its forecast of 2.5 million new members.The development sent Netflix shares down as much as 16 percent in after-hours trading on Monday, representing the second earnings report in a row that has sparked a double-digit plunge in the companys stock price. Mr. Hastings finds himself in a starkly different position from just six months ago, when he stood onstage at the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas and declared that Netflix would conquer the global market for streaming television, adding more than 130 countries to its world service map.At the time, the companys share had been soaring, surging 135 percent in 2015 as the top performer on the Standard & Poors 500-stock index.So far this year, Netflixs share price has declined about 14 percent. Still, some analysts pointed to the companys financials as proof that it would continue to deliver on its plans in the long term.

What makes this game unique is that it uses your phones location services and camera so that you can catch Pokmon in real life. That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game. So finding new Pokmon and checkpoints for the game actually requires you to get off the couch and walk down the block.How does this workThe game uses Google Maps technology to place your avatar on a virtual world that mirrors your real life surroundings. When you find a Pokmon, the game uses augmented reality (AR) to make it look like whatever Pokmon youve stumbled across is indeed standing right there in front of you. Who created Pokmon GoNintendo and the other creators of Pokmon teamed up with Niantic Labs to create the game. The former company was born inside Google; its founder, John Hanke, was a key leader of its Geo products (Google Maps, Earth).

The prototype touts a quad-core processor, a 4-inch screen and front and back cameras - at the astonishingly low price of 251 rupees (less than $4).While global brands Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. sell devices for less than $100, the $4 smartphone is the one stirring up the internet-hungry, app-crazy hordes in a country where Apple Inc. has been unable to make a dent. With iPhones costing upwards of $700, Apple commands a mere 2 percent market share in a country where the World Bank puts the per capita income at $5,630.Brands can't make money even on $50 smartphones, so profiting from a $4 device is a ludicrous idea, say experts like Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. While Micromax sells millions of cheap devices every month in smaller cities - it profits by taking advantage of economies of scale. Ringing Bells managing director Mohit Goel isn't counting on a profit from device sales, conceding that the company will lose hundreds of rupees on each unit, and is instead planning to recoup money through advertising and marketing deals. Goel has said the company is importing kits from Taiwan and assembling the phones in a factory in Haridwar near Delhi.Even at $4, the smartphone could still be out of reach for most because of scarcity. When Goel first announced Freedom 251 in February, the company said over 70 million jostled to register, crashing its website.

       " 'How AWS came to be:There are lots of stories about the formation of AWS, but this much we know: 10 years ago,Amazon Web Services, the cloud Infrastructure as a Service arm of Amazon.com, was launched with little fanfare as a side business for Amazon.com. Today, its a highly successful company in its own right, riding a remarkable $10 billion run rate. What you may not know is that the roots for the idea of AWS go back to the 2000 timeframe when Amazon was a far different company than it is today  simply an e-commerce company struggling with scale problems. Those issues forced the company to build some solid internal systems to deal with the hyper growth it was experiencing  and that laid the foundation for what would become AWS.Speaking recently at an event in Washington, DC, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, who has been there from the beginning, explained how these core systems developed out of need over a three-year period beginning in 2000, and, before they knew it, without any real planning, they had the makings of a business that would become AWS. It began way back in the 2000 timeframe when the company wanted to launch an e-commerce service called Merchant.com to help third-party merchants like Target or Marks & Spencer build online shopping sites on top of Amazons e-commerce engine. It turned out to be a lot harder than they thought to build an external development platform, because, like many startups, when it launched in 1994, it didnt really plan well for future requirements. Instead of an organized development environment, they had unknowingly created a jumbled mess. That made it a huge challenge to separate the various services to make a centralized development platform that would be useful for third parties.At that point, the company took its first step toward building the AWS business by untangling that mess into a set of well-documented APIs. While it drove the smoother development of Merchant.com, it also served the internal developer audience well, too, and it set the stage for a much more organized and disciplined way of developing tools internally going forward.',\n",

It could shift spending behavior if currency fluctuations make a purchase cost-prohibitive.\" ARM investors were quick to turn to its own calculations on the impact of currency moves and bet on an increase in profit. The company, which licenses chip technology and designs, gets more than a third of its sales from the U.S., 19 percent from China and another 25 percent from Taiwan and South Korea. Singapore and Switzerland supply it with more revenue than its home market at around 3 percent each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.According to a company presentation from April, more than 95 percent of ARMs sales are in dollars.

And not just because I was demoing the technology in the middle of the E3 floor, surrounded by fellow show-goers. Its just  well, even after all the explainers in the world, its hard to sufficiently brace your mind for all that virtual reality porn entails.It occupied a small space, tucked in the rear of the LA Convention Center, but Naughty America may just have had the one booth capable of rivaling Nintendos for sheer show buzz. We must have walked by the thing a dozen times during our three days on the floor, and there was always a small army of show-goers lined up to take it for a spin.Much like, say, your standard first-person shooter, the technology is built around a POV (point-of-view) shot, putting the viewer in the place of the camera. The effect is already a bit jolting (and, at times nausea-inducing) in standard VR, but all of that really goes next level when you look down and youve swapped your bits and bobs with someone elses.The companys demo cycles through a few short clips, in which the scenery, scenarios and co-stars change, but, well, the view pretty much stays the same. Its hard to say how much of the initial shock is due to the newness of the technology and how much is firmly entrenched in the uncanny valley, though the company told me that many attendees enjoyed the demo, strange setting and all.Once you get past the somewhat off-putting nature of swapping nether regions with a professional, VR porn does offer an interesting way forward for an industry that, like many others, has been hard hit by the prevalence of free online content.',\n",

Also, dont take out a loan at 4 a.m.Those are lessons from online lenders in China that are tracking peoples behavior -- via apps on their mobile phones -- and taking it into account when deciding what their credit ratings should be. Chinese consumers dont mind handing over personal details that would spark outrage in the West, in exchange for lower interest rates. WeLab Ltd., a Hong Kong-based online lender that makes loans in China, looks at what apps people have downloaded, where they go using the phones GPS tracker, their social networks and their school records. It offers discounted interest rates for each extra piece of personal information that helps profile customers for credit ratings. In Hong Kong, for example, giving WeLab access to a Facebook account gets a 5 percent discount on the cost of a loan, and access to LinkedIn gets you 10 percent off, on loans with interest rates that otherwise reach as high as 20 percent.\"Chinese people have no issue handing over their personal data, giving you their credit card number, giving you their bank account,\" said GGV Capitals Shanghai-based managing partner Jenny Lee, whose Silicon Valley venture capital firm has invested in data-hungry tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \"Look at the whole internet finance sector, people are giving you their bank statement so you can do profiling.\"Some are perhaps over-sharing.

       " 'Uber Rivals $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of Chinas Ride-Sharing Market:The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising. That Didis valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the markets difficulties. In part because of Chinas widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business. In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting Americas biggest tech company against Americas best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth. The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China. Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials.Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given Chinas unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.',\n",

Its easiest to illustrate with actual examples. Easily the most interesting VR experience Ive had at E3 (of a dozen or so) was an Oculus demo called The Climb, by a team at Crytek. Using the Touch controllers (a new innovation; previously a gamepad was used), you manipulate a pair of disembodied hands, gripping ridges and cracks to make your way up a cliff face. Like many VR games, it sounds rather boring. In fact, its genius, but only within VR  and like so many other games, the only way to find that out is to play it. Nevertheless, Its excellent for several reasons, and these act as sort of guidelines for content that fits VRs strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Alas, I was disappointed by Final Fantasy XV: The VR Experience, despite being hyped for the game itself. Here, I found, was the worst possible outcome: a game that should and could be interesting, but does almost nothing right.Unlike The Climb, it sounds like a blast on paper. You and the other main characters from the game are in a battle with a Behemoth, one of the games most well-known monsters. Youre Prompto, the one who has a gun, supporting your buddies as they fight hand to hand. What it amounts to, however, and Im heartily sorry to say it, is a disjointed and boring five minutes that may leave you less excited for the game than when you donned the headset.',\n",

Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market.The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date.Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand.Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued to a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Ubers valuation of $62.5 billion  making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world  would not change with this new investment.Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors  some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.',\n",

Their app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.For a long time, Apple didnt have to care. But now it faces flat sales of its flagship iPhones, a lack of excitement about newer products like its smart watch and Apple TV, growing competition from Googles Android platform and the rise of new challengers like Amazons Echo device, which responds to a users voice commands at home with the kind of magic that used to be an Apple hallmark.As the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Apples charm offensive began in earnest in December, after it put Philip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in charge of the App Store. Under Mr. Schiller, the company accelerated the app approval process, cutting typical review times from two weeks to a day or two.On Wednesday, Apple announced that it would soon begin allowing app makers to buy ads that would appear at the top of search results in the App Store, like the ads already on Googles Play Store and website.Apple also said that it would cut its usual 30 percent commission on all subscriptions to 15 percent after an app subscriber had been active for at least a year.',\n",

Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valleys venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84. Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins  and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif.  became a destination for other venture capitalists.Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.The firms success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world. Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the progressive war on the American 1 percent to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language.David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled Mines Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the Worlds Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkinss legacy wont be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed, though he was a seminal figure for Silicon Valley.',\n",

However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by market analysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Expanding the Series F with a Series FP, as its described in the document below, would also fit in with a description weve heard more than once about Snapchats fundraising: The startup is always raising on a rolling basis, partly because investors are so interested. They get offers all the time, one investor close to the company said. And once you start to grow on this path, many people come to give you money. You dont know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot company and many people are approaching you, you do a market of discovery. That may be different from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchats own fast growth and its taste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.',\n",
       " 'To halt smartphone slide, Samsung rewrites playbook:From the way it chooses smartphone components to the models it brings to market, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has undergone a painful process of breaking from its past to reverse a slide in its handset business. For example, the world\\'s largest smartphone maker agonized over camera specs for its flagship Galaxy S7 until the last moment - ultimately defying industry convention by opting for fewer pixels in exchange for improved autofocus features and low-light performance, a move that contributed to early success. It also pared back its product line-up, overcoming internal resistance, enabling it to streamline production, an executive said. The handset business has now stabilized, and had its best profit in nearly two years in January-March, though historically low smartphone industry growth still leaves Samsung looking for the \"next big thing\". After peaking in 2013, a sharp drop in mobile profits exposed Samsung as slow to adjust to the changing market: its budget devices were overpriced and unappealing versus Chinese offerings, and the 2014 version of its Galaxy S flopped. That prompted a cull among executives and stoked investor worries Samsung might not be able to recover as rivals including Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi gained market share at its expense. There was no sweeping, across-the-board fix. Rather, Samsung embarked two years ago on an overhaul that included a shift from a phone-for-all-needs approach towards a line-up that emphasized economies of scale. It revamped design, using metal frames and curved screens, and gave high-end features such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens to its low- and mid-tier products. The product cull paid off; the revamped models helped Samsung recover in big markets such as India. \"There was a feeling the sheer number of phones in the market was confusing for customers,\" said a Samsung India executive, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with the media.Samsung\\'s Kim says his focus now is on premium-end smartphones - those costing $600 and above - where not all industry players have the muscle to compete.',\n",

Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.So value investors took notice when Mr. Buffetts holding company,Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had invested $1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter.Weve just looked at it again, said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. Anybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.Value stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they havent already.Apple is going to attract more value investors, said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. Theyre looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.',\n",
       " 'This $5 Billion Software Company Has No Sales Staff:Atlassian sold $320 million worth of business software last year without a single sales employee. Everyone else in the industry noticed.: Atlassian, which makes popular project-management and chat apps such as Jira and HipChat, doesnt run on sales quotas and end-of-quarter discounts. In fact, its sales team doesnt pitch products to anyone, because Atlassian doesnt have a sales team. Initially an anomaly in the world of business software, the Australian company has become a beacon for other businesses counting on word of mouth to build market share. Customers dont want to call a salesperson if they dont have to, says Scott Farquhar, Atlassians co-chief executive officer. Theyd much rather be able to find the answers on the website. The way technology companies sell software has changed dramatically in the past decade. The availability of open source alternatives has pushed traditional brands and rising challengers to offer more free trials, free basic versions of their software with paid upgrades, and online promotions. Incumbents such as IBM, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which employ thousands of commissioned salespeople, are acquiring open source or cloud companies that sell differently, says Laurie Wurster, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub are among the companies trying to attract corporate clients with small-bore efforts that rely largely on good reviews. The idea is to distribute products to individuals or small groups at potential customers big and small and hope interest spreads upstairs. So far, though, Atlassian remains the most extreme example of this model. Its a 14-year-old company, valued at $5 billion since going public in December, without a single salesperson on the payroll. More than 80 Fortune 100 companies use Atlassians software, and venture capitalists and peers often talk about trying to follow, at least partly, its sales strategy.Atlassians roots lie in Sydneys barren tech scene. It was kept aloft early on not by venture capital, but by the founders credit cards, meaning it didnt have impatient investors to answer to. I dont think their success is replicable, says Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at Redpoint Ventures.',\n",
       " 'China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews:Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the countrys Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the countrys military and security agencies. While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.',\n",

The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities. The survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey's respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. The NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.\",\n",

The report also said editors were able to artificially inflate the importance of other topics by injecting them into the Trending section of users Facebook pages.Since those claims surfaced, Facebook has been questioned by news sites across the political spectrum and by legislators in Washington. On Thursday, critics urged the company to consider the biases of its editors.As long as Facebook is hiring editors who lean left politically, those stories are going to get preferential treatment, Erick Erickson, former editor in chief of the conservative website RedState and founder of another conservative site called The Resurgent, said in an email. Id hope that Facebook would take care to consider all views and all news.The company has continued to deny accusations of political bias and pointed to editorial rules that discourage Trending Topics staff members from taking one viewpoint or another.',\n",

Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professors overworked teaching staff.But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watsons true identity to students until after theyd turned in their final exams.Students were amazed. I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class! wrote one in the classs online forum. Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey! said another.Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesnt foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbots question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally dont receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the courses online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the classs previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jills answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as Where can I find assignment two and When is assignment two due Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.There are many questions Jill cant handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isnt human.',\n",

The new platform places Amazon in direct competition with Google\\'s YouTube, the firm leader in the video upload space that counts 1 billion users. YouTube has its own revenue sharing model for its top creators. Starting in 2007, it launched its Partners Program, which gave popular content creators a cut of the ad revenue earned from views to their pages.But there has been controversy in connection with the cut that YouTube takes, which is 45% of the revenue, and the site does not offer to cover any video creation costs, leading some YouTube creators to speak out about comparatively unfair profits.Amazon has not yet detailed what percentage of revenue creators will get with the Video Direct service. But it is offering a pay-to-subscribe option direct to each individual channel, similar to Twitch, which allows users to follow specific content creators for a fee. The owner of the channel would make a percentage of the profit from those subscriptions. Amazon will also pay out $1 million as a bonus among the creators of the top 100 videos viewed by Prime members each month.',\n",

They are using a Chicago-based company called Pay Your Selfie to gather those insights and present them in reports on consumer behavior that are meant to go where focus groups and surveys cannot.Among the tidbits that Crest, owned by Procter & Gamble, learned from its recent monthlong quest for selfies: Theres a huge spike in brushing from 4 to 6 p.m., probably tied to a desire for happy-hour fresh breath. That knowledge could be useful when Crest decides which times of the day to start future social media campaigns.Users of the app receive anywhere from 20 cents to $1 for each task completed  in Crests case, a snapshot taken while brushing your teeth with your favorite Crest product. Users cant double-dip; the app allows only one selfie per task.The selfies are a good way for companies to obtain information that people cant or dont articulate in focus groups or other traditional research methods, said Ravi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management. For example, they could lead to an understanding of which rituals go along with certain types of consumption, he said.Pay Your Selfie, which has been in business since last September, doesnt require participants to have followers on a site like Instagram.

Extending this practice to India would have likely helped it increase its share in one of the world\\'s fastest growing smartphone markets against competitors with much cheaper offerings.But India, which is pushing a \\'Make in India\\' initiative to boost the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, rejected the proposal citing rules against importing used electronics.Apple\\'s proposal was opposed by domestic phone makers who claim selling refurbished iPhones - devices that have been returned by buyers or repaired to factory condition after damage - would breach India\\'s anti-dumping rules. The Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association had written to India\\'s telecom ministry to stall the move. The news comes at a time when Apple posted its first-ever drop in iPhone sales amid weakness in China, its most important market after the United States.In India, Apple only has about a 2 percent market share but its sales there surged 56 percent in the first three months, driven mainly by cheaper older-generation devices such as the iPhone 5S while demand for the new iPhone SE disappointed.\"The 5S\\' success in India has more to do with affordability of a premium brand than a preference for smaller phones, and the move to the more expensive SE will discourage budget buyers,\" said Wilmer Ang, an analyst at research firm Canalys.The newly launched iPhone SE retails at 39,000 rupees ($585) in India - almost $200 higher than its U.S. price.To successfully tap into India\\'s smartphone boom - where sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year - Apple will need a better retail presence and cheaper versions of the iPhone given the average smartphone in the country sells for less than$150, according to analysts.Apple, which currently retails in India through local partners, is already seeking government approval to set up its first store in the country.',\n",

       " 'How Foursquare knew before almost anyone how bad things were for Chipotle:Chipotle announced its first loss as a public company Tuesday. But two weeks earlier, an unlikely source the social media app Foursquare  had beat Chipotle to the punch,predicting in a blog post that the burrito makers sales would drop nearly 30 percent. Chipotle made it official Tuesday afternoon  reporting a drop of 29.7 percent. The remarkably accurate prediction from a company consumers know for restaurant tips and the ability to check in at locations highlights the emerging power of the gobs of data our smartphones collect and the opportunity for savvy companies to convert that information into piles of cash. Foursquare has spent seven years collecting data and has 85 million places in its database. It describes its data trove as the biggest foot traffic panel in the world. Clients that buy Foursquares data to glean insights include retailers, real estate developers, Wall Street traders and consumer package-goods companies.Foursquare, the seven-year-old start-up, cleverly turned smartphone data into predictions on Chipotle sales that matched Wall Street analysts with far more experience in projecting the successes of businesses such as Chipotle. Last year, Foursquare used its foot-traffic data to predict how many iPhones Apple would sell on a given weekend. Foursquarepredicted sales of 13 million to 15 million. Apple then announced sales of more than 13 million.Once a handful of Foursquare users have checked in at a location, the company knows that a given location represents a certain store. If the smartphones of another Foursquare user move inside these premises  but doesnt check in  Foursquare still knows the user was in the store. Foursquare relies on GPS data, WiFi, cell towers and beacons to pinpoint where smartphone users are.Data experts caution that there are limits to how far Foursquare can replicate its Chipotle predictions elsewhere. They say Foursquares success will work best at large chains. Foursquare needs a lot of data to make such predictions, so it would probably struggle to accurately predict the sales of a retailer that has only a handful of locations.Another limitation to Foursquares approach is the nature of a store. Chipotle lends itself to a foot-traffic analysis because customers overwhelmingly travel in person to a store to get their food. It would be more difficult to predict the sales at a business that sells a significant amount of goods online.',\n",

While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise. After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple\\'s exponential growth. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \"The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\" he said. He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales. Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar. In reaction to Apple\\'s results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Broadcom and NXP Semiconductors all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.',\n",
       " 'The future of TV is arriving faster than anyone predicted: Late last week, Comcast announced a new program that allows makers of smart TVs and other Internet-based video services to have full access to your cable programming without the need for a set-top box. Instead, the content will flow directly to the third-party device as an app, including all the channels and program guide.The Xfinity TV Partner Program will initially be offered on new smart TVs from Samsung, as well as Roku streaming boxes. But the program, built on open Internet-based standards including HTML5, is now open to other device manufacturers to adopt.As video services move from hardware to software, the future of the traditional set-top box looks increasingly grim. With this announcement, Comcast customers may soon eliminate the need for an extra device, potentially saving hundreds of dollars in fees. Many in the industry have long predicted eventual death for the box, driven in part by a rapid migration by pay TV providers (including fiber and satellite-based companies) to Internet standards for both video content and services, and by the enthusiastic response of consumers to a growing number of Internet-based alternatives. These include Roku, as well as Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, SlingTV, Sony, HBO and many others.Consumers, especially younger ones, are interested in defining their own video experience, mixing traditional and self-produced content and enjoying it not just on televisions but on every connected device, including tablets, smartphones and other mobile gadgets.At this years Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it was clear that list would soon grow to include other non-traditional viewing platforms, such as cars, refrigerators and game consoles.Comcasts announcement suggests that future may already be here.',\n",
       " 'A Marriage Gone Bad: Walgreens Struggles to Shake Off Theranos:The sprawling drugstore chain, now a part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, was Theranoss first  and thus far only  direct-to-consumer retail partner, promising to eventually make Theranoss wellness centers an integral part of its more than 8,000 stores nationwide.When it announced the deal in 2013, Walgreens hoped to drive traffic to its stores and bask in the reflected glow from one of Silicon Valleys hottest unicorns and its youthful founder and glamorous chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes.For unproved Theranos, the Walgreens endorsement was akin to the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Theranoss valuation vaulted to $9 billion and put Ms. Holmes on the Forbes list of billionaires.Nearly three years later, with Theranos under siege on multiple regulatory fronts and its reputation in tatters, its clear that the relationship has been a disaster for Walgreens. The company has been trying to distance itself, halting expansion of Theranos testing in its stores and, in January, threatening to end the partnership if Theranos did not meet regulatory standards within 30 days.But that deadline has come and gone. With this weeks news that Theranos is under criminal investigation for, among other things, possibly defrauding Walgreens and other investors, the question is: What will it take for Walgreens to end its troubled relationship Theranoss lawyers have taken a hard line, insisting that Walgreens is contractually bound by their agreement. So far, the approach has worked. Walgreens appears to have taken a cautious approach toward terminating the relationship, perhaps preferring to wait until federal regulators impose penalties or the criminal investigation yields formal charges, either of which would strengthen Walgreenss hand.But that could take years. Theranos can appeal any penalties, and a grand jury investigation could be a protracted process. And Theranos is likely to sue Walgreens in any event if it terminates their agreement.In the meantime, Walgreens risks being dragged into nearly every negative story about Theranos.',\n",
       " 'Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face:For years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.Last week, Apples iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the governments approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The about-face is startling, given Apples record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products  like its mobile payments system Apple Pay  in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company.To a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software  including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad  to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is also reliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales.The company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. Its China numbers will be dissected on Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings.Chinas pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.They are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent, Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China is strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States. Sales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids, investigations and fines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses.Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time - so far.',\n",

But when the companys first-quarter numbers came in a little light on Thursday afternoon, its stock immediately plummeted.Both revenue and profit rose sharply from 2015 but missed analysts forecasts. Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.Revenue from what the company calls Other Bets  including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat  was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015. Losses for Other Bets rose to $802 million from $633 million.The number of employees jumped to 64,000 from 55,000 last year. The vast majority of them, the company stressed, were engineers and product managers. A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailers core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge.Google is far behind at No. 3, or perhaps even No. 4 after IBM, said John R. Rymer, an analyst at Forrester Research.

A user survey distributed this week hints at a broad range of ways that users could make money or promote a cause, including a tip jar, branded content and taking a cut of the ad revenue Facebook earns from posts. The survey also asked users to indicate their interest in a call to action button, a way to let followers make donations and a sponsor marketplace to match users with advertisers. Its unclear whether Facebook is considering making these options available to all users; the language of the survey indicated it is targeted at verified users. The survey was spotted on the page of a verified user with a relatively small following. (Okay, it was me.)Facebook does not currently offer individual users a way to earn money by posting on Facebook. It has allowed publishers to sell advertising inside its fast-loading Instant Articles format, and recently clarified rules allowing posts sponsored by brands to be shared by verified pages. Facebook is also testing ads within the suggestions that pop up after you watch a video, sharing money with publishers. But recently, the company has taken steps to make its publishing tools more widely available. In February, the company began letting anyone publish Instant Articles.',\n",

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits.Intel's shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.Up to Tuesday's close, Intel's shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year. Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The companys other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10,500 employees.\",\n",

The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding its international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content. That uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States.

The company, of course, is the owner of Oculus  the VR firm with the most general recognition  and just released its first commercial VR headset, the Rift. The Rift is focused on gaming right now, but Facebook has been saying since it bought Oculus in 2014 that it has broader plans for making Oculus\\'s technology work for more general social interaction. Sheikh laid out a world where users could play a poker game with friends over VR that is so sensitive that you can read their tells. He describes what it could mean to people who live far away from their families to be able to interact with them through a headset. And he said that eventually his team hopes to make VR social interaction \"indistinguishable from real life.\" Of course, this will all take a lot of work. Right now, the commercial Rift doesn\\'t even represent your hands in VR, though that is poised to changebefore the year is out. But Sheikh also described research that would let users put their whole bodies in a virtual world and accurately map facial expressions. The team is also trying to analyze real-world social interactions, to figure out how to let virtual interactions flow as seamlessly as in-person meetings.He also warned that all the visions he laid out in his portion of the keynote speech were far from ready for prime-time. A study released Wednesday by Greenlight VR predicted that it will take six to eight years for virtual reality to go fully mainstream.

To keep costs in check, Lyft has promised investors to cap its losses at no more than $50 million a month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Meanwhile, Uber has been working to fulfill its own promise to shareholders and employees that it would achieve profitability in North America by the second quarter of 2016, a milestone it says it has now reached in the U.S. and Canada. In February, Uber earned an average of 19 per ride in the U.S., according to previously undisclosed financial documents. Uber takes about a 25 percent cut of a typical fare, most of which goes to antifraud efforts, credit-card processing, customer support, marketing, and software development, the documents show. Not included in Ubers profitability calculations are interest, taxes, or equity-based compensation for employees.Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanicks commitment to profitability has left an opening for Lyft, and the smaller upstarts free-spending strategy is starting to pay off. Lyft says it has captured 45 percent of trips in Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles and 43 percent in San Francisco, where both companies are based. Uber says it had 55 percent of ride-hailing sales in Austin, 75 percent in Los Angeles, and 66 percent in San Francisco, citing third-party credit card data from the first two weeks of March. Uber says Lyft has shaken loose only a few percentage points. From everything Im looking at, were gaining share in all top 20 markets, which is where 80 percent to 90 percent of rides happen, says Lyft President John Zimmer. This continues to prove what we said all along, which is once you hit a certain level of scale, its a natural duopoly.Outside of big cities, though, its still Uber country. Of 169 million trips booked through Uber worldwide in March, the company says 50 million of those were in the U.S. Lyft says it did 11 million U.S. rides that month, up from 7 million in October.Lyft continues to devise newand often expensiveways to expand in the U.S., the only country in which it operates. When a Lyft driver refers someone to sign up as a new driver, both get a $750 bonus in some cities. And Lyft has the capacity to keep spending. Zimmer says the company still has by far the majority of the $2 billion its raised from investors. This allows us to control our own destiny. We do not need to raise any additional capital, and its just a fantastic position to be in.Whether Lyfts gains will stick remains to be seen. Uber says customers lured away by subsidies are the most likely to return if Lyfts prices go up. Its easy enough to buy trips with heavy subsidies for drivers and discounts for riders, Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, wrote in an e-mail.

The companies efforts to recover their rockets is part of what Bezos calls the Holy Grail quest of lowering the cost of space flight, which has been so prohibitively expensive that it has long been the exclusive domain of governments.Typically, the first stages of rockets are ditched into the ocean after firing their engines for a few minutes and boosting a second stage, or a capsule, to space.But if the commercial sector can build innovative rockets that can be reused, many think that would dramatically reduce the costs, a key step toward making space travel more routine.SpaceX broadcast the launch and landing live on its website, where some 80,000 viewers watched the booster descend toward the platform. The first stage was hurtling toward space when it started a bit of aerial acrobatics, turning itself around and heading back toward Earth.As it approached the platform, the booster was tilted into the wind but was able to right itself just before touching down, about nine minutes after liftoff.

The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.Last week, Indian regulators confirmed that online marketplaces, which had operated in a gray era, are legal. But they added a rule saying that no single seller can account for more than 25 percent of sales on such an e-commerce marketplace. It also limited the influence that online marketplaces can exert over the prices set by their sellers.The new regulations appear to make Amazons dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the sites sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R.

Nest currently sells three products: The flagship smart thermostat; Protect, its smoke detector; and Nest Cam, the home-monitoring video predecessor to Dropcam.But its below the initial expectations Google had set for Nest when it bought the startup in 2014 for a whopping $3.2 billion. The companys sales performance may face even deeper scrutiny inside Googles new parent company, Alphabet, where Nest now sits, as the hardware maker faces its most critical year ever.

And in the meanwhile,Nest's CEO got slammed in a column in TechCrunchfor the culture there:though the company currently manufactures three products  its thermostat, a smoke alarm, and its Nest cam (via its Dropcam acquisition)  it has repeatedly delayed product releases and disappointed its customers, particularly given the billing that Nests products receive.In one of the more visible cases of customer dissatisfaction, a New York Times reporter said in January that a software bug drained his Nest thermostats battery, a discovery he made only when his infant began crying from his chilly bedroom in the middle of the night. Nests smart smoke alarm has also been plagued by software glitches.In the meantime, says The Information, Google has moved forward on similar efforts, including its OnHub wireless router and a stealth project to create a competitor to Amazons Echo.That Google has done so without Nests involvement must be demoralizing to Nests current employees, who were presumably drawn to the challenge of helping Nest become one of the worlds great hardware companies.But theres reason for even more concern going forward: Fadell has created a culture thats increasingly unlikely to attract the worlds best engineers, which has always been the top priority for its parent company. (Google, in stark contrast, is consistently ranked as one of thebest places to work.)If Alphabet wants to maintain its feel-good reputation, it may be time to part ways with Fadell, or at least to demote him. Hes now had more than two years to prove himself.What Fadell has shown instead is that hes unable to get out of his own way  or Nests.\",\n",
       " 'Beijing Seeks to Tighten Reins on Websites in China:Chinas government said on Monday that it would take steps to more strictly manage websites in the country, its latest push to set boundaries in the wider Internet.A draft law posted by one of Chinas technology regulators said that websites in the country would have to register domain names with local service providers and with the authorities.It was not clear whether the rule would apply to all websites or only to those hosted on servers in China. Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply.If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country.If the law applies only to sites hosted in China, it would still represent a consolidation of power by Beijing. Forcing registration with Chinese entities is likely to create a new boom in domain-name service registrars. At the moment, Alibaba operates Chinas primary domain-name service provider, called Wan Wang.The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said. The new rules are the latest in a string of measures taken by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping to assert control over the Internet. This year, regulators created rules to block foreign companies from publishing online content in China without the governments consent. Regulators also shut down the social media accounts of the sharp-tongued tycoon Ren Zhiqiang.',\n",

The case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the authorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important.Yet law enforcements ability to now unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method. A second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apples iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.',\n",
       " 'In Yahoo, Another Example of the Buyback Mirage: It is one of the great investment conundrums of our time:Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that its buying back sharesStated simply, repurchase programs can be hazardous to a companys long-term financial health and often signal a management that has run out of better ways to invest in the business.And yet investors love them. Not all stock repurchases are bad, of course. But given the enormous popularity of buybacks nowadays, those that are harmful probably outnumber the beneficial.Those who run companies like buybacks because they make their earnings look better on a per-share basis. When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.But a companys overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.Consider Yahoo. The company bought back shares worth $6.6 billion from 2008 to 2014, according to Robert L. Colby, a retired investment professional and developer of Corequity, an equity valuation service used by institutional investors. These purchases helped increase Yahoos earnings per share about 16 percent annually, on average.But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoos overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.Yahoo is not alone. Mr. Colby conducted a cost-benefit analysis of 26 companies buying back stock versus using that money to invest in a business.He found that McDonalds was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonalds has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period. To equal that growth in overall earnings, the company would have had to generate just a 2.3 percent return on the money it spent buying back stock, Mr. Colby estimated.Last November, Moodys Investors Service downgraded McDonalds unsecured debt rating, citing its plans to increase its borrowings in part to fund future buybacks.',\n",
       " 'The Uber Model, It Turns Out, Doesnt Translate:Other than Uber, the hypersuccessful granddaddy of on-demand apps, many of these companies have come under stress. Across a variety of on-demand apps, prices are rising, service is declining, business models are shifting, and in some cases, companies are closing down. Here is what we are witnessing: the end of the on-demand dream. That dream was about price and convenience. Many of these companies marketed themselves as clever hacks of the existing order. They werent just less headache than old-world services, but because they were using phones to eliminate inefficiencies, they argued that they could be cheaper, too  so cheap that as they grew, they could offer luxury-level service at mass-market prices. So do a lot of other apps offering services across a number of industries. They are super convenient, but the convenience comes at a premium, which seems here to stay. Some of these services could make for fine businesses, but it is hard to call them groundbreaking. After all, paying extra for convenience isnt really innovative  it is pretty much how the world has always worked. Before we get to why many on-demand apps have struggled to achieve mass-market prices, it is important to remember why anyone ever thought they could: because Uber did it. The ride-hailing company that is valued by investors at more than $60 billion began as a luxury service. The magic of Uber was that it used its growth to keep cutting its prices and expand its service. Uber shifted from a convenient alternative to luxury cars to an alternative to taxis to, now, a credible alternative to owning a car. But Ubers success was in many ways unique. For one thing, it was attacking a vulnerable market. In many cities, the taxi business was a customer-unfriendly protectionist racket that artificially inflated prices and cared little about customer service. The opportunity for Uber to become a regular part of peoples lives was huge. Many people take cars every day, so hook them once and you have repeat customers. Finally, cars are the second-most-expensive things people buy, and the most frequent thing we do with them is park. That monumental inefficiency left Uber ample room to extract a profit even after undercutting what we now pay for cars.But how many other markets are there like that Not many. Some services were used frequently by consumers, but werent that valuable  things related to food, for instance, offered low margins. Other businesses funded in low-frequency and low-value areas were a trap, Mr. Walk said.',\n",

Uber alleged that Ola is intentionally causing it to lose sales. Uber alleged in court that Olas employees are making bookings on Ubers platform by creating fake accounts and then cancelling them. This is the equivalent of a shopping sites employee placing orders on a rival site and then returning the goods for no good reason. Uber calculated the total loss incurred by it because of such alleged practices by Ola and sought damages worthRs.496,164,780 from the latter. A total of 93,859 fake accounts have been created by Ola, which have been used to make 4,05,649 false bookings across various cities that were later cancelled, it said. Such cancellations roughly amounted to 8-10% of its total bookings, Uber added. Uber and Ola are fighting for dominance of Indias cab business that, according to Olas largest investor SoftBank Group, may be worth $7 billion by 2020. Justice Vipin Sanghi, who was hearing the matter, issued notices to both ANI Technologies Ltd (Ola) and Serendipity Infolabs (TaxiForSure, acquired by Ola) asking for replies to be filed before the next date. Olas statement denying all allegations was also recorded.

Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didnt respond to requests for comment. Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.At the heart of Replicants trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Googles other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the units failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group.

ET was not able to determine the exact timeline of these talks or if they were initiated by one of Flipkart's investors.Flipkart itself denied that it is up for sale, or that it is in the market for capital. Three of the sources, who are top-level executives in venture capital and private equity firms, said Amazon made a preliminary offer of up to $8 billion to acquire Flipkart, nearly half of its previous stated valuation of $15.2 billion. A mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley slashed the value of its Flipkart shares by 27% last month to about $11 billion, increasing speculation that new investors will back the company at a lower valuation.

A group of researchers at the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University has been exploring the limits of friction in the design of tiny robots that have the ability to pull thousands of times their weight, wander like gecko lizards on vertical surfaces or mimic bats.Now they have pushed biomimicry in a new direction. They have taken their inspiration from tiny ants that work as teams to move massive objects. In this case, they are not just taking ideas from nature  the movie Big Hero 6 made a great deal of what swarms of microrobots could do, including tossing cars.The researchers approach is counterintuitive. Rather than striking powerful blows like a football player making a tackle or a jackhammer, they have focused on synchronizing the smooth application of very tiny forces. The microrobots work in concert, if slowly.The researchers observed that the ants get great cooperative force by each using three of their six legs simultaneously. Their new demonstration is the functional equivalent of a team of six humans moving a weight equivalent to that of an Eiffel Tower and three Statues of Liberty, Mr. Christensen said.

At the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isnt made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon  a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop. What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isnt much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks  playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list  that you can already do on your phone. But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too. In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google  the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world  with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes. First, its simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitivethan those of many other vocal assistants (like Apples Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers. More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial  there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command  to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities. Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexas brain into their own devices, so soon you wont need an Echo to consult with Alexa  you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.',\n",

Thats six or seven times the $50 million in revenue Snapchat projected last year. Snapchats business is still new and evolving, and advertiser interest is still very experimental. Essentially that means it can be tough to predict incoming revenue with much accuracy, as most advertisers dont have Snapchat as a staple of their advertising plans.

Advertising is cyclical, and Q4 is usually a strong advertising quarter, but its worth noting because the run rate metric gives us a glimpse at how the business is growing.

It connects with phones and the Internet through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.The Tap acts as an ordinary wireless speaker for a phone, but it also provides Alexa on the go.

Made-in-Japan Kameyama model TVs, named for the factory, became a hit, and Sharp reaped big profits.We were winners then, said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp.Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt. Sharps plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japans in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industrys center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States.Sharps leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the companys financial distress.As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan.Sharp had found a rescuer in a Taiwanese company called Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple and others and was offering a $5.5 billion lifeline. But Sharp unexpectedly told its would-be rescuer last week that it could be liable for close to $3 billion in potential costs, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Foxconn is still examining the sudden disclosure, and it isnt clear whether the Taiwanese company will complete the deal.',\n",

Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country. Souqs latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank. Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group  which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009  still holds a majority stake. Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.',\n",
       " 'Morgan Stanley fund marks down Flipkart stake value by 27%:A mutual fund investor in Flipkart Ltd, Indias largest e-commerce firm, has slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%, the latest indication that the investor rush of the past two years into Indian startups has led to unsustainable valuations.Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust valued its stake in Flipkart at $58.9 million as of 31 December, down from $80.6 million in June 2015. The company reported the number late Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US stock markets regulator. Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust also cut the value of its stake in other high flying startups including file storage company Dropbox Inc. and data analytics company Palantir.Flipkart was valued at $15 billion when it received $700 million from Tiger Global Management, Qatar Investment Authority and other investors in June. That was its fourth round of fund raising in a year. Its valuation shot up roughly 5 times from $2.5-3 billion in May 2014. Morgan Stanleys latest estimate implies that the mutual fund currently values Flipkart at $11 billion. Mint reported on 4 February that Chinas Alibaba Group is in early talks to buy a stake in Flipkart and increase its holding in Flipkart rival, Snapdeal. The talks are at a very initial stage and the likelihood of a deal is a function of Flipkarts willingness to offer a discount on its current valuation of $15 billion, Mint had reported then. There are not too many takers for Indias top e-commerce firms at their current valuations, prompting both Flipkart and Snapdeal to approach Alibaba Group for cash. Early last year, Flipkart set a target of generating annualized gross merchandise value (GMV) of $8 billion by December. However, the companys current average monthly annualized GMV is roughly $5 billion, Mint reported on 17 February. This number, which includes sales at Flipkarts unit Myntra, indicates Flipkart missed its internal sales target.',\n",
       " 'Baidu Shares Rise 14% On Revenue Beat:Baidu Inc. posted revenue that topped analysts estimates as the Chinese Internet search providers investments in mobile begin to bear fruit and attract advertising. Sales rose 33 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in the December quarter from a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement. That beat the average analyst estimate of 18.5 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mobile revenue made up 56 percent of total sales in the quarter, up from 42 percent a year earlier, Baidu said.The companys dominance in search as more users shift to using mobile devices is helping offset the impact of a Chinese economy growing at its slowest pace in 25 years. Chairman Robin Li is also investing in services such as home delivery and online video to drive growth beyond advertising and help Baidu compete with Alibaba and Tencent. Baidus American depositary receipts rose as much as 14 percent to $179.90 in extended U.S. trading after the results were released. The stock has lost 16 percent this year. Investors are keeping a close eye on Baidus margins. Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu are now vying for supremacy in an on-demand services industry primed for growth as more people turn to their smartphones or the Web to order food, schedule beauty treatments or hire helpers. Users of such services could rise 29 percent to 400 million by next year, according to Shanghai-based IResearch.The rising cost of competing in online services is spurring consolidation, including the combinations last year of fashion sites Meilishuo and Mogujie, travel-site operators Ctrip and Qunar, and group-buying startups Meituan.com and Dianping.com.Baidu has had to keep spending on its video-streaming service IQiyi and main online commerce site Nuomi to keep pace with Alibabas and Tencents expanding rival platforms. Chairman Li and another executive this month offered to buy Baidus entire 80.5 percent stake in the IQiyi business, a deal that will shore up the search giants margins while setting up a potential initial public offering for the unit.These bold steps help to reveal its core operating margins and the earning power of its monopoly-like search engine business, HSBC Securities analysts led by Chi Tsang wrote in a report. Selling IQiyi could expand Baidus operating margins to 26 percent this year from 20 percent, even while unabated spending on on-demand services erases about 30 percentage points of profitability, they estimated.',\n",
       " 'Airbnb Admits It Removed 1,500 Listings in New York Before Releasing Data to Regulators:Before Airbnb Inc. shared data on its business in New York City, the home-rental website removed about 1,500 listings controlled by full-time landlords. The company disclosed the removals in a letter to New York state legislators on Wednesday as it faces criticism over becoming a platform for unregulated hotels. Airbnb said it kicked off 622 hosts as part of the effort in November. The cuts helped portray a rosier picture of its New York City operations in the data released in December. The company had not outlined the extent of its removals when it initially presented the data publicly. The deleted listings accounted for about 4 percent of those offered in the city. Josh Meltzer, the company\\'s head of public policy in New York, wrote in the letter to legislators that the listings \"did not reflect Airbnb\\'s vision for our community.\" Airbnb has faced questions from city officials who have said real-estate developers are using Airbnb to rent out homes instead of selling them to permanent residents. The practice risks driving up housing prices. Airbnb defeated a proposal in San Francisco last year that would have restricted the company\\'s business in its hometown. Airbnb spent $8 million to fight the effort. \"In New York City, where housing prices and availability are a critical issue, we want to work with our community and policymakers to help prevent short-term rentals from impacting the availability and cost of permanent housing for city residents,\" Meltzer wrote in the letter. \"While home sharing has been around for centuries, our people-to-people home sharing platform is new. And Airbnb is a young company. We have learned that a one-size fits all approach to cities will not work.\" Along with the letter to New York lawmakers, Airbnb released updated data on its operations in the city. Of hosts renting their entire homes in New York City, 38 percent of revenue came from those listing two or more homes on the website. Hosts with six or more homes on Airbnb generated 6 percent of revenue.',\n",
       " 'European Tech Scene Begins to Feel Silicon Valleys Woes:At the offices of Deliveroo, a food delivery start-up with headquarters in an upmarket neighborhood here, signs of activity are everywhere. The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about.The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.Over the last year, Mr. Shu has urged colleagues to be more circumspect with growth plans, forgoing rapid expansion in competitive markets like the United States to focus on places where Deliveroo already has a loyal following. And while the start-up has raised almost $200 million, employs roughly 400 people worldwide and operates in 12 countries, Mr. Shu says profitability  and not just aggressive growth to beat rivals to new markets  is increasingly important as the company moves beyond its British roots. The focus at Deliveroo is symptomatic of a change across many European start-ups. Just as in Silicon Valley, where a number of privately held tech companies have been stung by lower valuations and investor questions about their sustainability, that same unease has now reached Europes tech community, in a sign that a move away from soaring boom times in start-ups is going global.Driving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valleys start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown  exacerbated in Europe by the regions migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves. As a result, venture capitalists in Europe and farther afield are becoming more cautious about funding local start-ups that do not have proven business ideas.When Silicon Valley sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, said Fred Destin, a partner at the London office of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. Its only a matter of time before Europe faces the same issues that were seeing on the West Coast.In Europe, that is leading to situations like that of Powa Technologies. Last week , Powa, an e-commerce company based in London, entered into administration, a form of bankruptcy. The start-up had raised $175 million since 2013 but had failed to win enough customers for its mobile shopping technology. Deloitte, which is overseeing the sale of the companys assets, says it is now working to find buyers for the business.Truecaller, a Swedish start-up that had raised around $80 million for its caller ID smartphone application, recently laid off about 20 percent of its staff. A company spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs and said Truecaller remained committed to its business. And SwiftKey, a popular predictive typing smartphone application used by more than 300 million people worldwide, was bought by Microsoft this month for a reported $250 million, which was significantly less than what many of SwiftKeys investors had expected.You can already see more hesitance and lower valuations, Christian Reber, founder of 6Wunderkinder, a German start-up bought by Microsoft last year, said in an email. The market correction will continue, and thats not necessarily a bad thing.',\n",
       " 'A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.:While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls. Its remarkable what they can do, said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. If you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, its fewer and fewer firms. It is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion. And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader  one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firms capital. In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop. Here is a small sample of Jane Streets main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (masters in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (masters in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelors in computer science, Carnegie Mellon). Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business. Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level. Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firms program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading. And to the degree that the super-shy Jane Street does has have a public face, it belongs to its chief technology officer, Yaron Minsky, who givesfrequent lectures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Carnegie Mellon, promoting the firms ability to manage risk by developing the best software around.',\n",
       " 'New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms Online Content:China is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval. The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video. The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval. China already has some of the worlds most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years. One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apples Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.',\n",

       " 'Zenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups:Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly. Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.These grand promises were bolstered by Zenefits early growth. Its annual recurring revenue  an accounting measure preferred by subscription-based software companies  reached $1 million by the end of 2013, the year Zenefits was founded. Recurring revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by late 2015. The exponential growth was catnip to investors. The start-up raised $500 million last year at a $4 billion valuation, one of the largest financing rounds in a year of mega-fundings. At one point, Andreessen Horowitz, Silicon Valleys pre-eminent venture firm, had invested more in Zenefits than in any other company. In total, Zenefits has raised about $581 million. Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics. Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrads exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits. Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founders misdeeds. Zenefits recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when its down). That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors.Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship  only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems. Growth was the only imperative.',\n",
       " 'Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play:Tech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without. So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction. At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel Ready Player One is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsofts HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from Star Trek. Like many other people working in the tech space, Im not a creative person, said Palmer Luckey, 23, a co-founder of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Its nice that science fiction exists because these are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be. They come up with a lot of incredible ideas. Those ideas are especially relevant now, as some of the biggest technology companies are nearing a major push of a new generation of virtual reality products. In the next few months, virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and HTC go on sale. Venture capital money is pouring into the industry. But how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers. Science fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free, said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses. Techies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration. But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace  and often someone  they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters. Magic Leap, based in Dania Beach, Fla., and which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his seminal 1992 novel Snow Crash. In an interview, Mr. Stephenson  whose title is chief futurist  declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several content projects underway at the company.',\n",
       " 'Mattel Unveils ThingMaker, A $300 3D Printer That Lets Kids Make Their Own Toys:Autodesk was tasked with building this app which early testers, including those at Toyland, have already described as fast, easy to navigate and ridiculously intuitive.Called ThingMaker Design, the app includes a variety of built-in character templates and easy-to-use tutorials that help novices get started. But it also allows for designing characters from scratch, once kids get the hang of things. The toys can be customized with different colors and textures, and will bend and twist in the app so you can get a feel for how theyll work after theyve been printed. The creations can be saved as images to the mobile devices Camera Roll, or uploaded to Google Drive or Dropbox. When a design is complete, the app lets you export the STL print files wirelessly to your at-home printer, whether Mattels or otherwise. The idea isnt just to print an object and be done, however  instead, kids will print parts that can be assembled to form larger creations, like dolls, robots, dinosaurs, scorpions, skeletons, bracelets or necklaces, for example. Whats interesting here is the potential for Mattel to tie into other childrens brands it already owns or licenses and bring them to life through 3D printing. Thats something the company says is on the roadmap, saying it will launch additional design content, including branded options at a later date. No actual brand names were announced, however, but there were hints that brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels were already being planned. The physical parts are printed in batches then assembled through ball-and-socket joints that snap together. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes for a small item, up to overnight (e.g. 6 6 to 8 hours) for a larger toy.Mattel says its ThingMaker 3D will use a hard PLA filament, but also hasnt yet announced the colors that will be available. According to reports from the Toy Fair, though, there were some two dozen colors on display. A spokesperson said the company may release other materials in the future.',\n",
       " 'Creating a Computer Voice That People Like:The challenge of creating a computer personality is now one that a growing number of software designers are grappling with as computers become portable and users with busy hands and eyes increasingly use voice interaction.Machines are listening, understanding and speaking, and not just computers and smartphones. Voices have been added to a wide range of everyday objects like cars and toys, as well as household information appliances like the home-companion robots Pepper and Jibo, and Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo speaker device. A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called conversational agents, software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands. However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science. It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the uncanny valley, in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans. Beyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this prosody, the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language. Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence. The first experimental-research results  gained from employing machine-learning algorithms and huge databases of human emotions embedded in speech  are just becoming available to speech scientists.',\n",

Pandora is working with Morgan Stanley to meet with potential buyers, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The talks are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. For Pandora, it would be a curious time to sell. Its shares are yielding a market value of $1.8 billion, down from more than $7 billion two years ago. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since October. Pandora has the largest number of users for music streaming, but the competition is encroaching. Spotify is said to be arming itself with another $500 million in capital, and Apple Music recently surpassed 10 million paying users. Pandoras users peaked at 81.5 million at the end of 2014, and, after falling to about 78 million in the third quarter of 2015, ended the year with 81.1 million. The company is spending heavily to attract users, and its ability to make money from those users may be waning. In the third quarter, Pandora lowered its full-year financial guidance, expecting its adjusted earnings to be $51 million to $56 million, down from the $75 million to $85 million it projected in the quarter before. It has lots of users but cant grow revenue quickly enough, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. It is another stumbling pioneer.',\n",

       " 'Amazon Building Global Delivery Business to Take On Alibaba:In recent weeks, speculation has mounted that Amazon.com Inc. plans to launch a global shipping and logistics operation that will compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.Asked about reports that the company was leasing planes and had registered an ocean freight booking business, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky downplayed Amazons ambitions last month in an earnings call. He said the company was simply looking to supplement its delivery partners -- not replace them -- during peak periods like the Christmas shopping season. Amazon documents reviewed by Bloomberg News reveal a far bolder plan.A 2013 report to Amazons senior management team proposed an aggressive global expansion of the companys Fulfillment By Amazon service, which provides storage, packing and shipping for independent merchants selling products on the companys website. The report envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York and London. The project, called Dragon Boat, is proceeding, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who asked not to be identified because the information isnt public. The ambitious strategy promises to turn FedEx and UPS into Amazon rivals, but also will pit the Seattle giant against Chinese counterpart Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Both companies are vying for dominance of the rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce market, which by 2020 is expected to swell into a $1 trillion industry serving 900 million shoppers, according to a June report from Accenture and AliResearch, Alibabas research arm. Amazons plan would culminate with the launch of a new venture called Global Supply Chain by Amazon, as soon as this year, the documents said. The new business will locate Amazon at the center of a logistics industry that involves not just shippers like FedEx and UPS but also legions of middlemen who handle cargo and paperwork associated with transnational trade. Amazon wants to bypass these brokers, amassing inventory from thousands of merchants around the world and then buying space on trucks, planes and ships at reduced rates. Merchants will be able to book cargo space online or via mobile devices, creating what Amazon described as a one click-ship for seamless international trade and shipping.',\n",
       " 'Facebook Loses a Battle in India Over Its Free Basics Program:For years, Mark Zuckerberg has had a grander vision than just connecting the more than one billion people who already use Facebook: He wants to connect the entire world. That effort hit a major roadblock on Monday, when Indian regulators banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. The regulations, issued after months of intense public debate over how to extend the Internet to Indias poorest citizens, effectively block Facebooks controversial Free Basics program in the country. Free Basics offers people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet. Free Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerbergs program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the worlds tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative. Free Basics is now in 38 countries, from Indonesia to Panama. Facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap Wi-Fi to remote villages and to beam Internet service from high-flying drones. In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment. The program quickly became the target of critics, who said that it was an attempt to steer unsophisticated new Internet users to Facebook and other services that were working with the company. They argued that Free Basics and other so-called zero rating programs, which are a set of apps or sites that a mobile operator or I.S.P. does not charge customers to use, violated the concept of net neutrality. Facebook embarked on a blitz of paid lobbying and advertising to promote Free Basics, spending millions of dollars in media campaigns to convince locals its offering would be positive for the population. The company ran special banners in the Facebook news feeds of Indian users urging them to petition the government to allow Free Basics. Mr. Zuckerberg personally lobbied against the new rules, including writing an opinion column in The Times of India. Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking. Locals were wary of the companys unknown long-term plans for advertising or other parts of Facebooks business.',\n",

The company is resubmitting the request as it wasnt in the right format, the person said, without giving a time-frame for final approval.

The company makes most of its devices in China. Cook is hunting for fresh sources of growth after Apple last month forecast a sales decline for the first time in more than a decade. India now has the worlds fastest-growing major economy and about 220 million smartphone users.

LinkedIn had 414 million users in the fourth quarter, up from 396 million in the prior period. While Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner has made investments to diversify the business, like acquiring education website Lynda.com for $1.5 billion last year, it will be a while before those efforts contribute meaningfully to revenue. In the meantime, LinkedIn is facing a slowdown in its marketing-services business, which companies use to find potential customers, show them ads and relevant information and generate sales leads. Sales to recruiters, who use LinkedIn to find candidates for jobs, are also slowing. LinkedIn is narrowing its focus in some areas, which is hurting sales. For example, its discontinuing a tool that helps marketers find leads, incorporating the technology into its sponsored content business instead, contributing to a slowdown in its marketing solutions business. Revenue in the marketing solutions division rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter to $183 million. The professional-networking website is also facing slower economic growth in Europe and Asia, though it said China is its fastest-growing country for new members. The company has a standalone app for Chinese users and has devoted much of its efforts over the past year to push deeper into that market. For the fourth quarter, LinkedIn reported a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.43 million, compared with the average estimate for $50.2 million. Revenue climbed 34 percent to $862 million, topping the prediction for $857.4 million.',\n",
       " 'Lenovo Tumbles as Sputtering PC, Phone Demand Hammers Sales:Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged in Hong Kong trading after quarterly revenue declined for the first time in more than six years on stalling demand for phones and computers. Shares fell 10 percent in their biggest decline in two years. The worlds largest PC maker said revenue dropped 8 percent in the three months ended December, even as broadening cost cuts delivered a surprise rise in net income. Lenovo is relying on cutting $1.35 billion from annual costs and eliminating 3,200 jobs to shield its earnings from intensifying smartphone competition and a shrinking market for PCs. While its expanding into other businesses, the company still gets more than half of revenue from a market that Intel Corp. last month warned was off to a soft start in 2016 amid tepid economic growth. Focusing internationally helped Lenovo lift the proportion of smartphone shipments from outside China to 83 percent from 59 percent. Expansion into markets from India to the U.S. helped shore up margins even as its global market share slipped about 1.5 percentage points to 5.1 percent in the period. The company once hailed as a symbol of global ambitions for Chinese corporations now faces the twin challenges of a competitive global smartphone and PC environment and a home country growing at its slowest pace in a quarter-century.',\n",

       " 'Alphabet, Googles Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close in on Apple:Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of a new conglomerate called Alphabet on Monday. Investors liked what they saw so much that the outfit formerly known as Google is poised to become the worlds most valuable company. Alphabets total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014. Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Googles core business is performing. The new disclosures, combined with its more investor-friendly tone and, of course, continued strong growth in its advertising business, are the main reasons Alphabet stock has jumped 43 percent from a year ago, putting it neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere. Or at least that was what happened with Amazon, which recently began separating its retail operations from the results of its highly profitable cloud computing business, and Netflix, which used segment reporting to show investors that while it might be losing money internationally, its North American streaming business is doing well. Advertising continues to account for the lions share of the companys revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising. This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Googles mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.',\n",
       " 'Microsoft Plumbs Oceans Depths to Test Underwater Data Center:Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industrys most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill. Todays data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash. Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity. The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity. Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage. The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the worlds population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users. The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule  eight feet in diameter  that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected. The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night. The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsofts Azure cloud computing service.',\n",

       " 'Facing a Price War, Uber Bets on Volume: The U.S. operation cuts fares while promising imminent profit.Its becoming a bit of a holiday tradition for Uber: ringing in the new year by lowering fares. Amid a price war with rival Lyft, the ride-hailing leader reduced its rates by 10 percent to 45 percent in 100 cities across North America. In Detroit, Uber drivers per-mile rate is less than it takes to cover their gas and the depreciation of their cars, according to IRS figures. Its depressing, says Bill Scroggins, an Uber driver in Indianapolis. Im not even sure I want to drive anymore. It feels like Im doing it for free. This is the third year in a row Uber has discounted fares in January. It calls the cuts seasonal but says they could last indefinitely. Last year rates never rose again in almost a third of cities; only in two did they return to precut prices. Uber has instituted temporary hourly wage guarantees to limit drivers earnings declines. Its assured Scroggins and other outraged drivers theyll come out ahead by making more trips an hour thanks to increased demand. That may be what Uber is telling itself, too. A few months ago, Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick told employees that North American operations would turn a profit in the second quarter of this year. The goal sounds less realistic in light of the price cuts. Uber has to sacrifice profits for growth, says Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School. Uber is also churning through cash a lot faster than Lyft, having said it will spend billions to push its way into China, India, and Southeast Asia. In the first quarter of 2015, Uber lost $385.1 million on $287.3 million in revenue, according to leaked figures published by the Information, a tech news site.

No more catered lunches, gold-plated benefits or million-dollar views from the search giants Manhattan office.

       " \"Social media buy buttons are n't off to a great start, but they might still be big:In the past year, theres been a flurry of experimentation with buy buttons, a way for social-media sites to allow users to purchase cocktail dresses, throw blankets, candle-making kits and sundry other items from retailers without leaving the social network. Pinterest launched buyable pins in June, the same month Instagram released its similar shop now feature. Those offerings joined ongoing tests by Facebook and Twitter for similar functionality. The rush by tech giants and retailers to join the buy-button arms race would suggest that these businesses see money-making potential. And given how much time people spend on social media  an estimated 1 of every 5 minutes spent on a mobile phone in the United States is on Facebook or Instagram, for example  it would be logical to assume that these buy buttons are bringing retailers a blast of online sales. But this holiday season, social channels accounted for 1.8 percent of overall online sales, according to data from Custora, whose software platform is used by many retailers. Thats just a tiny sliver of purchases, and its not even growing: In 2014, Custora found that social media led to 1.9 percent of sales during the same time period. But even if buy buttons have not had an explosive launch, experts say they could prove to be a crucial solution to some of retailers biggest online shopping problems. Right now, stores are seeing a massive conversion gap on mobile devices, meaning that there has been a surge in the number of people browsing sites from mobile devices, but only a small share of them are actually making purchases. In studies, shoppers frequently say they dont buy on their smartphones because it is a hassle to enter payment information and go through a checkout process on the small screen. Buy buttons could also help retailers re-create the idea of the impulse buy for the online era. On the web, a shoppers journey so often begins with a search in Amazon or Google for a specific item. That has made it hard for retailers to do what theyve long done in stores with elaborate window displays and sweet treats near the checkout counter: Persuade you to buy something eye-catching on a whim.\",\n",

In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the companys revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly. Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion. The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent. Intels share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening. Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014. On Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intels much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the companys operating profit margin. Keeping up with Moores Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion. Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moores Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip. If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements.

(Among Netflixs many competitors is Amazon itself, which has its own growing and well-regarded original-content division) A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others. Like Amazon, Netflix is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and its using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. And finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.',\n",

Now the company wants to give people something to do while theyre in the car. On Tuesday, Uber introduced a way for smartphone app developers to create trip experiences for riders. The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle. Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride. What if developers could also offer users of their apps new ways to enjoy themselves  or get stuff done  while theyre on the road Chris Saad, head of product on Ubers developer platform, wrote in a company blog post. These integrations help make life simpler and easier for people to get around. Uber has long been selective about how it works with partner apps and companies. It has struck deals with Facebook, Foursquare and OpenTable to allow users to hail rides from inside the companies apps. Uber is also working with a handful of retailers in some cities for its delivery service, UberRush. For Uber, the goal is to make the user experience more pleasant than a usual ride, which may in turn drum up repeat business and affinity for the companys brand. The company has struck similar partnerships in the past, such as one with Spotify, in which users can select the songs being played during their Uber rides. This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developers trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past. The announcement coincided with Ubers first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas.',\n",

The stock has lost about a quarter of its value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. \"This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. \"The Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.\" Apple shares fell on the report. Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit, which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time. Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple.',\n",
       " 'Augmented Reality Versus Virtual Reality: Understand the Difference:The Battle Is Real: Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have existed in some form for decades, only recently have they garnered mainstream attention. VR is blowing up right now, and its content and hardware advances have been exciting to watch. In a short amount of time, content creators have made some mind-blowing advances in storytelling with this new technology. Brands, movie studios, gaming companies and news organizations are all tinkering with this tool and channel. VR will gain ascendancy throughout 2016, but my moneys on AR becoming the dominant technology in our daily lives. The New York Times recently distributed more than one million Google cardboards to its digital-edition subscribers. YouTube and Facebook are enabling VR online through digital video players. Everything is aligning to have VR hit critical mass next year. VR is the only medium that guarantees the users complete focus on the content. There is no looking away, no checking email or text messages and no updating social-media statuses. VR is the most immersive way to tell a story because what happens inside that headset makes you feel something in your head, heart and gut. But VRs biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. The immersive nature of VR hinders users from interacting with their surroundings. It takes them out of the moment. They cant walk around and see what is right next to them, look people in the eye or read someones body language. VR is a powerful way to experience content, but is not practical for interacting in the real world. And therein lies the major problem with VR. Content is king, no doubt, and providing immersive experiences is the holy grail in advertising. But VR will never become an innocuous part of our daily lives. AR adds contextual layers of information to our experiences in real time. We have seen this future foretold in Hollywood films, such as Avatar, Minority Report, Iron Man and Wall-E, among others. Soon these depictions will become real. However, AR has issues with execution, which tends to feel gimmicky. Remember pointing your smartphone to a print ad to get some poorly made content Google Glass showed some innovative AR applications, but they were ultimately a failure because the hardware and technology were too broad and lacked focus on the consumer problem they were trying to solve. These examples have shown the promise of AR, but have failed to deliver on contextual utility. Still, the future is bright for AR with several tech companies working on their AR offerings. Microsoft is working on HoloLens AR headset glasses. Developer kits are scheduled to hit the market in early 2016. Google invested in a company called Magic Leap, whose technology beams lasers into the viewers iris to activate AR. That future will become a reality in another years time. Both VR and AR tinker with our reality  but AR enhances it, while VR diverts us from it, which is why the latter will come to the fore in 2017, with its promise of contextual data for marketers and utility for consumers.',\n",
       " 'Facebook fights for Free Basics in India, global test-case:India has become a battleground over the right to unrestricted Internet access, with local tech start-ups joining the front line against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his plan to roll out free Internet to the country\\'s masses. The Indian government has ordered Facebook\\'s Free Basics plan to be put on hold while it decides what to do. The program, launched in around three dozen developing countries, offers pared-down web services on mobile phones, along with access to Facebook\\'s own social network and messaging services, without charge. But critics say the program, launched 10 months ago in India in collaboration with operator Reliance Communications, violates principles of net neutrality, the concept that all websites on the internet are treated equally.

       " \"Few Computers Are Powerful Enough to Support Virtual Reality: VR headsets are almost ready to hit stores, but less than 1 percent of PCs will be capable of running them.Virtual reality has a very real problem. With several technology giants preparing splashy introductions for the first VR headsets in 2016, few people own hardware capable of fully supporting Facebooks Oculus Rift or other systems. Just 13 million PCs worldwide next year will have the graphics capabilities needed to run VR, according to an estimate by Nvidia, the largest maker of computer graphics chips. Those ultra-high-end machines account for less than 1 percent of the 1.43 billion PCs expected to be in use globally in 2016, according to research firm Gartner. VR headsets, which create immersive 3D environments the wearer can interact with and explore, are poised to be a star of CES 2016. The massive consumer electronics trade show, which kicks off in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, will have more than 40 exhibitors demonstrating VR products, a 77 percent increase from 2015. Taiwanese gadget maker HTC is expected to show off a new version of its Vive headset at CES before releasing it in stores in April. Facebook is still on track to sell its first VR product to consumers by the end of March, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey tweeted on Dec. 22. I think the technology has significant potential, but I also think we have to be realistic about how strongly it will be adopted in the short term, Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst for researcher IHS, wrote in an e-mail. The hype is somewhat understandable considering the investment some big technology companies are making in VR. However, VR headsets come to market with a number of specific challenges. IHS estimates that 7 million VR headsets will be in use by the end of 2016. The Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, forecasts VR headset sales of 1.2 million units in 2016. While that's a sixfold increase from last year with total revenue of $540 million, thats a ways short of covering the $2 billion Facebook paid for Oculus VR in 2014. Theres a very good reason why VR demands such processing power: Anything less, and you might hurl. Early VR prototypes caused many testers to suffer from motion sickness due to slight delays in the screens responses to the users movements. A standard PC game runs at 30 frames per second. But to deliver the fluid, natural motion our brains need to be convinced an image is real, VR needs to achieve 90 frames per second on two video projections (one for each eye). Right now, that means a $1,500 laptop.\",\n",

A spokeswoman confirmed the layoffs, but did not disclose how many recruiters the company still employs. In a statement, CEO Apoorva Mehta attributed the job cuts to the companys plans to be less aggressive in hiring in 2016 than it was in 2015, when its staff tripled, from just under 100 employees to a little more than 300. A person familiar with the move, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the company likely should have employed fewer full-time recruiters and more contractors since it was unlikely that last years pace of hiring would continue indefinitely. Those affected by the cuts will be paid through the end of January, this person said. Instacart delivers groceries in 18 American cities from big chains like Whole Foods, Costco and Target and smaller grocers like Fairway and Zabars in New York City. Customers place orders through Instacarts website or app, and the goods are whisked from local stores to customer doors, usually within an hour. A substantial portion of Instacarts revenue originally came from marking up the in-store price of a given item, but the company now often charges the same price as the grocer, but takes a cut of the sales from the store. Earlier this year, Instacart finally began being transparent about when it was charging higher prices than its partner grocers.',\n",

       " 'Apple Pay Seeks Growth in Asia, Europe After Slow U.S. Adoption:After a sluggish start in the U.S. since its debut more than a year ago, Apple Pay is ramping up in markets where people are more comfortable with so- called contactless payments. The service, which lets consumers pay in an app or by tapping their iPhone on store terminals, will be introduced next year in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain. Apple is counting on its brand recognition as it enters markets that are further along than the U.S. in all things mobile payments, particularly in advanced technologies needed to accept them in retail outlets. Still, it wont be easy. The iPhone maker will compete with local banks and Internet companies that already offer the service -- not to mention Samsung Electronics Co., the worlds leader in smartphones. The mobile-payment service, which only works with Apple devices, is a way for the company to make products more appealing and spur customer loyalty. After Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called 2015 the year of Apple Pay in January, the service has been slow to take off domestically, partly because of a lack of promotion and a limited number of store terminals able to accept it. China: Apple said its service will be rolled out as soon as early 2016.  Last week, Apple teamed up with Chinese bank-card association UnionPay, which will make Apples market entry a lot easier, said James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC. Still, Apple Pay will compete with services like Tencents WeChat and Alibabas Alipay that control more than 75 percent of the mobile-payments market. And Apple should be prepared to race with Samsung, which also announced a partnership with UnionPay and plans to bring Samsung Pay to China as soon as early 2016.',\n",
       " 'Indian Regulators Suspend Facebooks Free Basic Services:Telecommunications regulators in India have ordered the suspension of Facebooks controversial program to bring free basic Internet services to mobile phone users in the country. Facebooks program, called Free Basics, is one of the signature projects of Internet.org, the companys ambitious plan to bring the Internet to the billions of people around the world who do not have it. Under the initiative, the company works in partnership with local telephone carriers in 35 countries to offer free access to a text-only version of the Facebook social network as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. The idea is to give novices a taste of the Internet and encourage them to buy paid data services when they want to explore the Internet more widely. But critics say that by offering a free package of handpicked services, Facebook and its partners are discouraging people from using competing services and violating the principle of net neutrality, which calls for telecommunications carriers to treat all Internet services equally. In India, for example, the program offers free web searches using Microsofts Bing service but Google searches incur a charge. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, has been particularly keen to expand Free Basics in India, which already has more Facebook users than any other country except the United States. Facebook has waged an aggressive advertising campaign in newspapers and on its own social network to build support for the program. But Facebook has encountered a series of setbacks, including intense opposition from net neutrality advocates, the poor marketing efforts and weak network of its Indian phone partner, and skepticism from regulators. One of those regulators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, has now told Reliance Communications, Facebooks partner in India, to stop offering Free Basics. The order  which was quietly issued about two weeks ago but leaked to the Indian news media this week  came after Reliance failed to turn over information about the terms and conditions of the service, which it had planned to expand across the country beginning last month.',\n",
       " \"Elon Musk's SpaceX Successfully Lands Rocket After Launch of Satellites Into Orbit:People living along the central Atlantic coast of Florida have for decades enjoyed the spectacle of rockets headed for space. On Monday night, they were treated to a new sight that may become common: a rocket coming back down to a gentle landing. It really felt like it was right on top of us, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX for short, said during a telephone news conference afterward. For SpaceX, the 8:29 p.m. liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was a threefold success. First, it marked the companys return to flight after half a year. In SpaceXs last launch attempt, a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station disintegrated. Second, SpaceXs upgraded design for its Falcon 9 rocket worked flawlessly. The liquid oxygen was chilled to minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit, about 40 degrees colder than on earlier flights, and the kerosene fuel was cooled to 20 degrees instead of 70 degrees. Most significant to SpaceXs ambitions, however, is that after the second stage of the rocket with the satellites continued on to orbit, the engines of the booster stage reignited to turn it around, back to Cape Canaveral. Currently, most rockets are launched just once, the boosters falling back to Earth as expensive junk. Making spaceflight more like air travel, with rockets capable of being refueled and sent up again, is essential for SpaceXs long-term goal of sending people to Mars. Its all the difference in the world, Mr. Musk said, absolutely fundamental.\",\n",

It used to be the get-rich story happened for people who joined in the early days, says Saar Gur, general partner at Charles River Ventures. Now they can be among the few left behind. Many executives, early investors, and even later investors are able to cash out before the rank and file, or bargain for guarantees that help ensure a bonanza. Whatever happens with an IPO, executives tend to hang on to enough equity to guarantee huge payouts when they sell their shares. Most early investors get a chance to sell options on secondary markets before a companys IPO. Later investors increasingly demand preferential treatment, including agreements that if an IPO underperforms the terms of their investment, theyll be made whole with an equivalent amount of additional shares. Late-stage investors in both Box and Square had such so-called ratchet agreements in place, further devaluing locked-up employee equity. When those kinds of deals are in place, employees often find their payouts disappointing because theyre so diluted, says Clara Sieg, a partner at Revolution Ventures. Box and Square declined to comment for this story. Ordinary employees are typically without meaningful financial protections or even a clear sense of what their equity stakes mean, says Chris Zaharis, whos worked at startups for about 20 years and as a volunteer teaches people about their equity rights. Options grants often dont come with information on strike prices (discounts on shares), preferential treatment, or even the total number of shares outstanding.

Policy makers have waited a long time for this moment: Since December 2008 the Fed has held the benchmark rate near zero, the centerpiece of its campaign to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment from the recession. Fed officials predicted that they would raise interest rates by about one percentage point a year over the next three years  an indication that they would be taking a slow-and-steady approach to economic expansion. The cost of borrowing is expected to rise, but only slightly, with variable effects on what banks charge for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and some student loans. Remember, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said the Fed will move cautiously in raising its benchmark rate. Financial markets were encouraged by the Feds announcement.

       " 'Holiday Shopping Is Chilly for Buy Buttons at Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest:More than a year after Twitter and Facebook began placing Buy buttons on their social networks, their e-commerce initiatives still appear to be relegated to experimental side projects. And at Pinterest, the tech platform that many believe is most conducive to e-commerce, one of its mainstream launch partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day via so-called Buyable Pins. The lack of aggressiveness on the part of Facebook and Twitter, and tepid early results at Pinterest, highlight the myriad challenges all three platforms face in transforming their immense user bases into shoppers. The sluggishness of the combined efforts also serves as a warning to other industry players betting big on the idea of social commerce that its still unclear if consumers will make purchases in big numbers on platforms that arent mainly retail destinations. Spokespeople for the three companies declined to disclose sales numbers for these initiatives. While each platform had its own reasons for pursuing e-commerce initiatives, the central idea was that they thought there was an opportunity to make it easier for their users to buy a product when they discover it on the platform. In theory, the usefulnesses of such a feature would be the biggest on mobile phones, where clicking through to make a purchase on another site can make purchases less likely because of uneven mobile webpage experiences. Facebook was the first to take a crack. Sixteen months after Facebook first began testing Buy buttons on ads and regular posts to let people purchase products they discover on Facebook without leaving Facebook, the initiative is still being dubbed a beta test, restricted solely to online merchants who work with e-commerce software provider Shopify. The company has also recently added purchase capabilities to some Facebook business pages and to a dedicated shopping section of Facebook, but these features, too, are being characterized as tests that arent available to all Facebook users in the U.S. At Twitter, its still unclear how big of a priority e-commerce will be going forward under the leadership of new CEO Jack Dorsey. The company began placing Buy buttons in tweets in September of 2014, and struck partnerships in October of this year with software partners such as Bigcommerce and Stripe to get more merchants on board. Best Buy, for example, will soon join the program  just not in time for the just-passed Black Friday weekend. But regular Twitter users can still go weeks without seeing any tweets enabled with e-commerce; most Re/code colleagues I polled, who are absolute Twitter power users, said they never come across them at all. Then theres Pinterest, the massive tech platform that retailers were most excited about for its e-commerce potential. The company began inserting Buyable Pins into its iPhone app in late June, and just added the feature to its Android app in early November. The company says more than 10,000 merchants have joined the program, including big retailers and brands like Macys, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Cole Haan and Tory Burch, but at least one of these big partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day on Pinterest, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sales figures. This source and another also said that Pinterest insiders have privately admitted to being disappointed with early sales numbers.',\n",
       " 'Thanksgiving Final Results  OmniChannel Strikes Back:This morning we are releasing the final results from Thanksgiving 2015. What stands out is the Omnichannel players with stores and online marketplaces (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) did extremely well. This indicates that these Brick and Clicks retailers were really able to tie their store and online promotions together with great success. This data is date-shifted to compare Thanksgiving this year (Nov 26) vs. last year (Nov 27). In summary, Thanksgiving 2015 blew the doors off, coming in at 43.4% y/y growth compared to 20.1% last year  more than twice the rate of growth. The trick is while we know that Thanksgiving 2015 was very strong, we dont know if this will continue through the entire Cyber Five and through all of Holiday 15, or if consumers are shopping much earlier than last year and will taper off as we get past Thanksgiving. Omnichannel marketplaces led the pack with Google Shopping and Amazon also outperforming. From a device perspective, Smartphones were 58% of traffic compared to last years Thanksgiving 35% and a new high water mark for this device type in our data. From an order perspective, smartphone came in at 37% which was also more than double last year, although conversion rates continue to lag desktop and tablet considerably. Conclusion: consumers not only increased their Thanksgiving sales, but they utilized their smartphones heavily and favored omnichannel retailers.',\n",
       " 'Indias Grofers Grabs $120M To Bring Offline Merchants Into The On-Demand World:The race for on-demand delivery services in India is on, and today one of the bigger startups in the market has picked up a large cash injection as it goes for pole position. Grofers, an Instacart-style app that links up with local, offline merchants to delivery groceries, medicine, flowers, and other daily items to customers, has raised $120 million led by new investor SoftBank. The Series C round also included existing backers DSTs Apoletto Managers, Tiger Global and Instacart investor Sequoia Capital. Grofers CEO and co-founder Albinder Dhindsa and SoftBank have both directly confirmed the round and investors to TechCrunch. Grofers has been on a fundraising tear to aid its expansion. This is the third round raised by the company this year alone, after earlier rounds of $10 million and $35 million. It brings the total to just under $166 million including an earlier seed round. Japans Softbank has been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into Indian startups like Ola, Snapdeal and more, and as part of this round it will take a seat on Grofers board. The Times of India, which first reported the raise, cites sources that say Grofers now has a post-money valuation of over $300 million. Dhindsa, who cofounded the company with Saurabh Kumar, would not comment on the valuation and said he hadnt even wanted to make this fundraise public. Very honestly its just a distraction for the team, he told TechCrunch. Were in the middle of trying to build a business. Today, that business is currently live in 26 cities in India, with some 1.6 million downloads of the mobile apps that are used to order its services. While Grofers looks on the surface like another Instacart clone, there is more going on under the hood. The company originally started as a B2B provider of a supply chain platform it built to help larger brands distribute consumables to smaller merchants, and for those smaller merchants who are almost completely offline to better keep track of their stock. In India, retail is very unorganised, so we see an opportunity in helping small merchants come online, Dhindsa says. Still, perhaps to tap into a more mass market prospect, it recently pivoted  or expanded may be the more accurate term  to make its business more consumer-facing, by offering those small, offline businesses an additional service: a way of showing their stock to consumers, who can order and have items delivered. Typically, Grofers offers some features to businesses for free, such as its inventory management system. It then takes a cut on other business software and services, as well as on the delivery, which can range at prices to consumers of between $1 for groceries to $0.40 for medicines (not as cheap sounding in India as it may be in the U.S.). Dhindsa says that the funding will be used to continue growing its supply-chain management development, but also to continue building out its last-mile infrastructure. Today, Grofers uses a mix of its own employees and contractors to deliver goods. Perhaps cleverly, it has chosen not to make delivery the cost-and-profit focus of its whole operation. In fact, its even considered partnering with others for that aspect of its business.',\n",
       " 'Xiaomi\\'s $45 Billion Valuation Seen `Unfeasible\\' as Growth Cools:Things were going so well for Xiaomi Corp. Customers were lining up, investors were swooning and the Beijing-based startup closed funding at a $45 billion valuation. That was last year. Now the high-flying smartphone maker is stumbling. Founder Lei Juns latest business, one of Chinas most exciting startup stories of the past few years, is likely to miss its own goal of selling 80 million smartphones this year, according to two people with knowledge of its production plans. Suppliers also cut their internal targets for Xiaomi in anticipation of the shortfall, they said. Xiaomis falter shows the startups challenge in trying to maintain momentum after a meteoric ascent past Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. Investors bought into the companys story of youthful disruption and online sales, yet the subsequent lowering of Chinas growth target and the copying of its sales strategy by rivals have neutralized Xiaomis first-mover advantage, putting its high price tag in doubt. \"All those expectations of growth arent being realized, which now makes that $45 billion valuation unfeasible,\" said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"The argument was that their business is kind of like Apple and theyre growing very fast, but theyre no longer growing so fast and theyre not as good as Apple.\" Domestic shipments of Xiaomi smartphones, including its premium Mi 4 and more economical Redmi series, dropped 8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its first-ever decline, according to researcher Canalys. IHS, another research firm, estimates that Xiaomi shipments dropped 3.9 percent, barely maintaining the lead over Huawei Technologies Co. Thats a big change from the bold growth projections used to justify Xiaomis tag as one of the worlds most-valuable technology startups. In March of last year, Lei predicted selling 100 million smartphones in 2015. Through the first nine months of this year, Xiaomi shipped about 53 million smartphones. With its optimistic forecast, Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in December from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd. and DST. Xiaomi drew comparisons to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company that months earlier held the largest initial public offering ever.',\n",

The iPhone maker has struck deals recently with China's big four state-run banks, the newspaper reported late Monday, citing people familiar with the discussions. When launched, Apple Pay will mainly compete with Alipay, the online payment platform run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that has a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. Apple's plans could still face regulatory hurdles in China, where banking and e-commerce are overseen by a number of government agencies, WSJ said. Launched in the United States in October last year, Apple is bringing its payment service to China, the most important market for smartphones. The company's sales nearly doubled in Greater China in its fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. The amount Apple would make off such transactions has been a sticking point in negotiations to bring Apple Pay to China, the Journal quoted the people as saying.\",\n",

       " 'Once Valued At $4.5B, LivingSocial Offers a Cautionary Tale to Todays Unicorns:The first thing you see when walking into the headquarters of LivingSocial is row upon row of mostly empty desks, broken up by small street signs that employees once needed to find one another when the office teemed with people. One row, BYFAD Lane, was named after a start-up, BuyYourFriendADrink, which LivingSocial acquired to get into the daily deals business. Other signs, such as Sky Diving Street, were named for some of the hottest discount coupons that the company once provided. On a recent visit, some desks were piled high with boxes of employee belongings, the detritus left behind after a round of layoffs that eliminated one-fifth of the work force. In one refrigerator, the milk was six months old. The technology industrys boom over the last few years has been defined by the rise of unicorns, the private companies that investors have valued at $1 billion or more. Before the term came into vogue, LivingSocial was among the biggest unicorns of its day. It now offers a glimpse of what some of todays unicorns might look like several years down the road if things go awry. Just four years ago, LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon grew rapidly on a simple pitch: The companies would match customers to local businesses with a daily deal in users inboxes, like half off at a local deli or a two-for-one massage promotion. LivingSocial and Groupon would take a cut of each transaction. Venture capitalists anointed daily deals as the way that the Internet would invade local business, and by late 2011 LivingSocial had raised more than $800 million and reached a valuation of $4.5 billion, according to data from the research firm VC Experts. The company counted Amazon and the mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price among its investors. LivingSocial spent heavily, blanketing the airwaves with TV ad campaigns. Riding a wave of momentum, the company explored going public. Today, LivingSocial is more unicorpse than unicorn. The company never filed for an initial public offering and consumer fervor for daily deals has cooled. T. Rowe Price has written down its stake in LivingSocial to nearly zero, data from Morningstar shows. The companys work force has shrunk to around 800 employees from 4,500 at its peak in 2011. Groupon, which did go public, is trading at more than 85 percent below its I.P.O. price.',\n",
       " 'Successful Tech IPO#1:Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering:Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07. The first-day pop followed a turbulent I.P.O. process for the six-year-old company, one that was marred by questions over pricing and valuation and that arrived in the face of a precarious public market for technology offerings. On Wednesday, when Square had priced its shares at $9, that was lower than the $11 to $13 range it had set, putting its valuation at $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion price tag that private investors had valued the company at last year. As recently as Wednesday, advisers laid out options for Square including pulling the deal, three people briefed on the discussions said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but for Square, that was not a consideration. We have a great beginning, said Jack Dorsey, Squares chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday. I dont see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work. The I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties  some might say guesswork  of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up. I want to get back to a steady state and back to business, Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Squares strategy now was to continue to save people trips to the bank. Were not going out there to say were getting rid of the banks or card networks. Weve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.',\n",
       " 'Square prices shares at 52% discount to last valuation in disappointing turn to long-awaited IPO: sources:Mobile payments company Square Inc priced shares at $9 late on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter, further discounting the company\\'s valuation before it begins trading Thursday morning. Square has raised $243.5 million in its Wall Street debut, about $80 million less than expected. The price set on Wednesday puts Square\\'s market capitalization at $2.9 billion, a 52 percent drop from the $6 billion valuation it had earned at its last private funding round. San Francisco-based Square, led by CEO Jack Dorsey, earlier this month set a price range of $11 to $13, well below the $15.46 per-share price of its most recent private financing. The steeper discount to $9 - a 42 percent drop from what investors were willing to pay a year ago - suggests widespread uncertainty about the profitability of the payments industry and the future of Square itself, which has seen slowing revenue growth. \"The way that Square was valued as a private company is they were just going to disrupt everything and change payments,\" said Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, an exchange-traded fund for mobile payments companies. \"And the reality is not that.\" Compounding concerns is Dorsey\\'s dual role running Twitter Inc., a social media company struggling for a turnaround. Founded in 2009, the company started as a way for small businesses to accept credit card payments through mobile devices. It has evolved to a suite of small business services, relying on partnerships with companies such as Apple and Visa. The valuation cut triggered a ratchet, or protection investors wrote into previous funding rounds, that requires Square to sell several million additional shares. Square will begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SQ\". Square is one of the most prominent \"unicorns,\" or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, to plan a public debut this year. Many have held up Square as an example of how fleeting - and at times nonsensical - private market valuations can be. There are more than 140 \"unicorns\" globally.',\n",
       " 'Earnest, Fueled by Growth in Student Loans, Raises $275 Million: At the start of this year, Earnest was an intriguing but small entrant in an emerging field of start-ups using new tools of data and software to analyze credit risk and make consumer loans. Its loans were typically a few thousand dollars for things like relocation expenses and professional training. But today, the lender, based in San Francisco, is growing at a torrid pace, and on Tuesday it announced a $275 million round of debt and equity to fund further expansion. Already this year, Earnest has made 50 times as many loans as last year, and it is lending from $2 million to $5 million every day, said Louis Beryl, a co-founder and chief executive. In this round, $75 million is equity investment, and $200 million is debt funding. The debt portion is led by New York Life. The new financing brings the total raised by Earnest, founded in 2013, to $325 million. Earnest now employees 165 people, up from 30 at the start of this year. Mr. Beryl says he plans to hire about 200 more employees over the next year, especially technical people like software engineers, data scientists and user-experience designers. The long-term goal, he said, is to build a platform for the next generation of consumer financial services. The financial service that has carried Earnest so far is refinancing student loans, which it began at the end of January. It is by far the largest part of the companys business, and Earnests success points to the opportunity in services to ease the burden on the nations debt-laden students and recent graduates. Student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, growing by about 10 percent a year. Student loans are held by 40 million Americans. Earnest is focusing on the more indebted recent graduates. The size of its average refinancing loan is $70,000. The start-up says the average saving, on its refinanced loans, is $18,000, typically over 10 years. Other online lenders, like SoFi and CommonBond, have also done well in the market for refinancing student loans. But Earnest says its approach is particularly data-intensive, which it says allows it to tailor rates to individual circumstances. It asks its customers for digital links to their bank, credit card and retirement and investment accounts, and information on all their loans. They are willing to share their data for a better consumer finance experience, Mr. Beryl said. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest has made individual loans of more than $250,000. Traditional credit scoring, Mr. Beryl said, tends to punish high student debt loads. But such Earnest borrowers, he said, are in fields like brain surgery and dental surgery, where education is lengthy and costly. These are people with great jobs, great educations and great earning potential, he added. Earnest borrowers average a bit over 30-years-old  young people with slender credit histories and thus charged higher rates by traditional banks. Mr. Beryl said Earnest has had no delinquency problems on its student refinancing loans. And Mr. Beryl, 34, is one of those prompt-paying customers. Having attended Princeton, Harvard Business School and Harvards Kennedy School of Government, he had $100,000 in student loans at the start of the year. He has paid down some, but still holds student loan debt, he said.',\n",
       " 'Chip-Only, or Chip-And-Pin Credit Cards Give Retailers Another Grievance Against Banks:The employee perched on a stepstool by the checkout at Trader Joes in Union Square in Manhattan is like an air traffic controller: Register 6 for one customer. Register 9 for the next. The routine helps move traffic quickly through the store, where the lines can often snake around the aisles of whole grain cereal, mixed nuts and Fair Trade coffee. Trader Joes, like many retailers around the country, recently upgraded its payment terminals around the Oct. 1 deadline to accept debit and credit cards with a new security chip. The timing, retailers say, could not be worse. The new terminals are often slower, meaning that the long lines during the busy year-end holiday season will grow longer. The new chip cards are also at the center of a growing dispute that has pitted two of Americas most prominent industries  banking and retailing  against each other, and pulled in attorneys general and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the process. But the debate involves more than whether consumers will be adequately protected during a season that has been rife with security breaches: The battle could affect the long-simmering war over the billions of dollars in interchange fees that merchants pay to process credit and debit transactions. That is the crux of the matter, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a payments industry publication. The real savings is not about fraud, the real savings is about interchange. Last year, merchants paid about $61 billion in interchange fees, Mr. Robertson said, compared with about $30 billion in fraud losses. The fight involves new payment cards, issued over the last year, that come with a small square security chip that can help make in-person transactions more secure. Retailers complain that they have spent billions of dollars upgrading their payment terminals to accommodate a system that cuts down only on the fraud shouldered by banks, not merchants. Chip and PIN, long the standard in Europe, would help retailers verify not just the card, but the person using it. Writing to their colleagues in October, two attorneys general sounded a warning bell: The new security chip would not go far enough to make transactions safer. Credit cards needed a PIN, too. If we continue to settle for weaker standards here, we will continue to pay the price, wrote Sam Olens, the Republican Georgia attorney general, and George Jepsen, his Democratic counterpart in Connecticut. They urged top prosecutors in other states to sign a separate letter to Visa, MasterCard, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and other institutions, pushing them to adopt the chip-and-PIN technology. Banking groups were swift to issue their own statement, saying that merchants had been spreading an outdated narrative. In November, a spokesman for Mr. Olens confirmed that he had taken his name off the letter.',\n",

       " 'After Square and DropBox, possible decline in Snapchat valuation signals trouble for unicorns:The worth of hot technology start-ups seemed for years to go in only one direction: straight up. Now there are signs of growing unease over the dizzying valuations of some of the most richly priced private companies. The latest sign has emerged with one such favorite, Snapchat, being discounted 25 percent by one of its more recent investors, Fidelity, the mutual fund giant. Another start-up, Dropbox, the widely used file storage service, was devalued by the giant asset manager BlackRock this year. The funds markdowns may tap the brakes on a fast-growing market. Investors, in the hopes of getting a piece of the next Facebook or Google, have been pouring billions of dollars into young private companies. Yet the public stock market has cooled for new technology companies: witness the current effort by Square, a mobile payments company, to go public at a valuation lower than what its last private investment gave it. The moves by Fidelity and BlackRock reflect how mutual funds can create challenges for technologys favored start-ups, just as they helped inflate valuations in the first place. Over the last few years, mutual funds fought to buy pieces of appealing venture-backed companies like Snapchat and Dropbox. The idea was that public investors wanted to own these start-ups because their value was growing faster than that of many publicly traded companies. By owning the private shares, the large mutual funds would also get to know the start-ups and be well positioned to buy their shares when they went public. As mutual fund and venture capital investors jockeyed with hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds to invest, their abundant capital pushed prices for private shares into the stratosphere. Snapchat, for example, is valued at more than $16 billion and Dropbox at around $10 billion. The biggest prize of them all, Uber, is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at $60 billion to $70 billion. Ubers success with that round would be a further test of investors appetite. The competition among investors also helped create a herd of dozens of unicorns, a term for private companies valued above $1 billion, coined when such a phenomenon was still considered rare. Yet unlike venture capital firms, mutual funds are legally obligated to value each of their portfolio holdings every day, including hard-to-value assets like shares in private companies, and they must report these values at least every half year. A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, one of the largest mutual fund associations, said that the process was a good faith determination of what an owner could get in a sale of the asset.',\n",

Net profit rose to $896 million, up 11 percent from a year ago.The revenue and profit increases came alongside a surge in spending. Facebooks expenses totaled more than $3 billion in the third quarter, a 62 percent leap from a year earlier, meaning that spending growth is outpacing sales growth. The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., emphasized that it had no intention of slowing that down as it invested heavily in hiring, marketing, new technologies and other initiatives.',\n",
       " 'Gmails Inbox app will now write (some of) your e-mails for you:Google just gave a little bit of help to anyone tired of typing out the same reply to e-mails over and over again. Now, software will do some of the work for you.An updated version of Inbox, one of Google\\'s mail apps, will \"read\" your e-mails and offer up suggested replies. In a company blog post, Gmail software engineer Blint Mikls said Tuesday that the feature \"uses machine learning to recognize emails that need responses and to generate the natural language responses on the fly.\" The goal is to have options good enough that a user will send short messages in just two taps. And the suggestions are designed to get better as you use the feature more often, and Inbox learns your personal quirks.',\n",
       " 'Snapchats new Terms of Service freaked people out because no one reads them:Snapchat updated its Terms of Service last week, and the Internet freaked out a little bit. Some users interpreted changes to mean the company could now hang on to users\\' private messages, broadcast them publicly and sell them to third parties. The pushback grew so loud that Snapchat took to its blog Sunday to explain itself, saying that private Snaps and Chats are still automatically deleted from its servers once viewed or expired. But, Snapchat said, its new Terms of Service granted the company \"broad license\" to user content. The company said those clauses are meant to apply to images and videos users share publicly for its \"Live Stories\" feature, which may be syndicated across other platforms. The new policy was also expanded to account for its Replay feature, which charges users who want to rewatch videos more than once, the blog post said.',\n",

On the other, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, which will sell the computer servers, data storage, networking, software and consulting services that run a modern company. Each company is expected to have annual revenue of about $50 billion and will be among Americas 500 largest public companies.Neither will have the standing as one of the most innovative operations in the world that the old HP enjoyed for decades.',\n",
       " 'Alphabet Edges Toward Settling the Android or Chrome Question:For years, Google, now known as Alphabet, has supported two operating systems on two very different tracks: Android and Chrome. But now the company is nodding in the direction of Android. Google is working toward allowing its low-cost Chromebook computing devices to work on the popular Android operating system. The work will take place over the next year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Google is not indicating it plans to stop development of Chrome OS, but making Android work on Chromebooks opens the door to one of the few products that Chrome OS, the lesser-known operating system, had to itself. Chrome OS should not be confused with Googles popular Chrome web browser. The first Android operating system for mobile devices was introduced about seven years ago as a direct competitor to Apples iOS mobile operating system. Since then, it has become the most widely used operating system in the world. Its development was led by an executive named Andy Rubin, who went on to lead much of the companys robotics efforts before leaving Google last year. Google introduced Chrome OS about a year later, surprising some who wondered why the company needed two operating systems. Interestingly, its early development was led by Sundar Pichai, who is now the chief executive of the part of Alphabet that is still called Google. Chrome OS has gained a following in academia but very few other places. According to IDC, a market research firm, about 3.9 million Chromebooks were shipped to the American education sector last year. If Google should drop the Chrome OS, it will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft. The latest version of Microsofts flagship Windows operating system is meant to run on both PCs and mobile devices. Apple still supports separate operating systems for mobile devices and PCs.',\n",
       " \"Flipboard's Fanfare Fades as Executives Exit, Sale Talks Stall:Flipboard Inc. debuted in 2010 with the kind of fanfare any startup would envy. The news-reading app piggybacked perfectly on the debut of Apples iPad tablet and Steve Jobss promise of a new era for digital media. Critics loved Flipboards magazine-like layout, created by one of the first software designers of the iPhone, and investors poured money into the company. Almost five years later, Flipboard is struggling to live up to the praise. Several senior executives have departed, including co-founder Evan Doll, and talks to sell the company havent reached the finish line, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not be named discussing private matters. Flipboards woes are indicative of a larger malaise gripping startups across the technology landscape as questions emerge about the sustainability of the tech-investment boom. Flipboard is performing well enough -- and, after raising more capital earlier this year, is at no risk of going out of business -- but is no longer a breakaway hit. People are finding media through their Facebook or Twitter feeds, limiting the need for a stand-alone application like Flipboard. Meanwhile, advertising rates -- the companys main revenue stream-- have been in decline. While Flipboards reading app was a showpiece for the iPad five years ago, the company is now working to adjust to a changing digital-news market and live up to its $800 million valuation. Other companies facing similar questions about whether they can make good on early investor expectations -- and lofty private-market valuations -- include online storage service Dropbox Inc., note-taking company Evernote Corp., music-streaming service Deezer SA and blood-testing company Theranos Inc., said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of CB Insights, a firm that tracks startup investing. The companies face a challenge in that they could be too expensive for another company to buy, yet may not have the business fundamentals to justify their valuations to public investors through an initial public offering, he said.\",\n",
       " 'Apple Profit Is Up 31%, Revenue Up 22% as iPhones Sell Briskly, but Its Forecast Is Muted:Apple on Tuesday turned in another quarter of enviable revenue and profit growth, fueled by sales of the iPhone. But the results raised a perennial question for the worlds most valuable company: How can it keep its growth streak alive The issue was stoked by Apples muted forecast for its all-important holiday quarter, as well as the unwillingness of Timothy D. Cook, the companys chief executive, to go into detail in an earnings conference call about how Apple plans to rev up sales next year. Over all, Apple posted a profit of $11.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $51.5 billion, up 22 percent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates. Yet while the performance was bolstered by sales of the iPhone  Apple said that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 39 million in the same period last year  the company was more cautious about sales for the key holiday sales period. Apple projected revenue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year quarter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell below Wall Street estimates and would amount to anemic growth of less than 4 percent from a year ago. The last time Apples quarterly sales fell below 4 percent was in mid-2013.New Products:Apple is going into 2016 with a full slate of refreshed products. In late September, the company introduced its newest iPhone models, the 6s and 6s Plus. It also announced a larger iPad, the iPad Pro, and will begin shipping a new Apple TV this week.IPad Struggles:While the iPhone continues to grow, the iPad has been facing declines. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPad sales dropped 20 percent from a year ago, making it the seventh consecutive quarter that sales of the tablet have slipped. The company is increasingly positioning the iPad as a business device.Apple Watch:The company did not break out sales of the Apple Watch, which debuted in April. But the category called other products  which includes the watch  posted $3 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the previous quarter, which was the first quarter that included sales of the device. Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the numbers for the other category were in line with his expectations, and implied somewhere between 3.5 million and four million watches were sold over the quarter.China:One of Apples fastest-growing markets  China  continued to grow. Sales in the region that Apple calls Greater China jumped 99 percent in the quarter to $12.5 billion. The region remained the companys second-largest market after the Americas, accounting for 24 percent of sales in the quarter, compared with 13.7 percent a year ago. Investors have been scrutinizing the China business given that the country has been cutting interest rates to shore up a slowing economy.Apple Pay:Apple said it has partnered with American Express to bring its Apple Pay mobile payments service to global markets. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the credit card company will bring the service to customers in Australia and Canada, then expand to Spain, Hong Kong and Singapore in 2016.']"
